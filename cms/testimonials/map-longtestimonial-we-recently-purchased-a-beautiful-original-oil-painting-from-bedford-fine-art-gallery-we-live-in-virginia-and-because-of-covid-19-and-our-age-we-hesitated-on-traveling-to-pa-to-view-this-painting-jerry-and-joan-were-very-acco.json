  "longTestimonial": "We recently purchased a beautiful original oil painting from Bedford Fine Art Gallery. We live in Virginia, and because of Covid 19 and our age, we hesitated on traveling to PA to view this painting. Jerry and Joan were very accommodating. We set up a meeting place in VA, and Joan and Sarah, Art Specialist, met us with the painting, and the purchase was made at that time. This was a 3-4 hour drive for them. We highly recommend Bedford Fine Art Gallery, if you're in the market for some quality art work.",
