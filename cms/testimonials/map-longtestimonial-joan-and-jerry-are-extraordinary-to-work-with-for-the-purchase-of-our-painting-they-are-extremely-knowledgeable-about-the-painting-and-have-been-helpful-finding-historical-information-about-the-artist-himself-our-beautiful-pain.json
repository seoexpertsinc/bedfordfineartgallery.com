  "longTestimonial": "Joan and Jerry are extraordinary to work with for the purchase of our painting. They are extremely knowledgeable about the painting and have been helpful finding historical information about the Artist himself. Our beautiful painting hangs proudly where all can see and enjoy it. The restoration work enhanced the lighting and colors making the painting more realistic and enjoyable. A joy to experience. We will most definitely use the Bedford Gallery for future purchases and restorations Thank you so much for all your terrific service and talent.",
