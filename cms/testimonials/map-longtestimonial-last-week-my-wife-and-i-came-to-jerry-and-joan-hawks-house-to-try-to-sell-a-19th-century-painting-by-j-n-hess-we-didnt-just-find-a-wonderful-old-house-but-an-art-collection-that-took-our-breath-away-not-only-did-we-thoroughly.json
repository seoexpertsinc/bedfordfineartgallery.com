  "longTestimonial": "Last week my wife and I came to Jerry and Joan Hawk's house to try to sell a 19th century painting by J.N. Hess. We didn't just find a wonderful old house, but an art collection that took our breath away. Not only did we thoroughly enjoy our time with the Hawk's, but we sold the painting. It was a delight to have several hours with some very interesting and helpful people.",
