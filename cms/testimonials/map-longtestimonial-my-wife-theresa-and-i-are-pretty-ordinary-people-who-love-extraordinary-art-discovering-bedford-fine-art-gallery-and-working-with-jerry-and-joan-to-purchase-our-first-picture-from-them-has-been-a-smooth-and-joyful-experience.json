  "longTestimonial": "My wife Theresa and I are pretty ordinary people, who love extraordinary art. Discovering Bedford Fine Art Gallery and working with Jerry and Joan to purchase our first picture from them has been a smooth and joyful experience — and we haven’t even met in person yet. Gotta love internet commerce! And while we anticipate a wonderful visit to the actual gallery one day, our trust in their expertise and integrity is complete. “Stepping Stones,” a beautiful British landscape, is now under our family's care for the second 150 years of its life, and more, I hope, a trust we welcome. Thank you Jerry and Joan!",
