  "longTestimonial": "We recently consigned several pieces of art to The Bedford Fine Art Gallery. It is hard to part with treasures, but Jerry and Joan were most accommodating in meeting us halfway in West Virginia. We appreciate their professionalism, received prompt payment for the sale of the first art piece and look forward to continued successful transactions.",
