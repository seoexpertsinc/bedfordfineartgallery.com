  "longTestimonial": "My wife and I recently had the opportunity to visit the Bedford Fine Art Gallery. We were very impressed by the consistently high quality of the works of art on display there. The owners, Joan and Jerry Hawk, were very knowledgeable about each work of art in the Gallery and the art market in general. We found them to be very honest and sincere and never pushy about making a sale despite our interest in several pieces. A few weeks later we decided to purchase an oil painting from them. The overall transaction and delivery exceeded our expectations and we love the painting. If you are interested in purchasing a fine work of art from a dealer you can trust, I would highly recommend Joan and Jerry of the Bedford Fine Art Gallery.",
