  "longTestimonial": "My husband and I were in the market for 19th century paintings and while doing research I came upon the Bedford Fine Art Gallery website. The music that was playing on the video showcasing the gallery's paintings was our wedding song. One of the paintings by the English artist William Bromley III reminded me of our first date. At that moment the painting met its new owner. Jerry spent much time discussing the details of the painting and about the artist. He also talked about two other paintings that were done by Bromley. The breadth and depth of Jerry's knowledge of art is very impressive. What I especially appreciated was his down to earth manner and his willingness to know his customers. In addition to the \"first date\" painting, we purchased the two other paintings by Bromley that tell the story of two friends enjoying nature. At the time, I also had my eye on another painting called \"The Diary\" by a well known French artist August Toulmouche. Due to budgetary constraints I had to let it go but had a feeling I would see it again (I did check now and then to see if anyone purchased it--it was still there!). We then went to Paris to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary and that same year I was turning 60!! In keeping with the French theme, my husband purchased \"The Diary\" as a birthday gift and voila all is well with the world. My belief is that paintings wait for us until we are ready to embrace them into our life and our home. To those of you yearning to go back to the 19th century, the Bedford Gallery will take you there!",
