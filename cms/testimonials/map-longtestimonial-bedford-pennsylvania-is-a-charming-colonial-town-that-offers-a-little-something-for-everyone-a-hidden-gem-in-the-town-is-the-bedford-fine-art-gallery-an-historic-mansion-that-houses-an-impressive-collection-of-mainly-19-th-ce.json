  "longTestimonial": "Bedford, Pennsylvania, is a charming colonial town that offers a little something for everyone. A hidden gem in the town is the Bedford Fine Art Gallery, an historic mansion that houses an impressive collection of mainly 19 th century paintings. Joan and Jerry Hawk have turned their beautiful home into a gallery that is warm, welcoming, and filled with significant pieces of art. Everything was impressive, from the careful positioning of the artwork, that caught the light perfectly, to Jerryâ€™s extensive knowledge of the history and background of each piece, to the warm welcome and great customer service. Our impulsive stop while strolling through town turned into a several-hour visit and, ultimately, resulted in the purchase of a unique painting that we could not resist. The Bedford Fine Art Gallery is a destination must that we highly recommend for anyone who appreciates classic American art and superior service.",
