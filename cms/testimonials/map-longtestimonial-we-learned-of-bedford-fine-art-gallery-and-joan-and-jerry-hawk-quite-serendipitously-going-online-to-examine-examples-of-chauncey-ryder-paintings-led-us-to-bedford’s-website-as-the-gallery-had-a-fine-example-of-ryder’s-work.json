  "longTestimonial": "We learned of Bedford Fine Art Gallery and Joan and Jerry Hawk quite serendipitously. Going online to examine examples of Chauncey Ryder paintings led us to Bedford’s website, as the Gallery had a fine example of Ryder’s work. Suffice it to say, we were more than pleasantly surprised. A truly incredible website. Really! I was \"detained\" there for almost two hours and have returned periodically. Pictures are worth thousands of words, literally. Any reader who heeds our advice and visits the site will be happy to confirm our praise. We encourage all to visit and get to know Joan and Jerry. Most knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating, and a pleasure to deal with. Be sure to plan for (at least) an hour’s visit. One special painting after another, after another, after another. Trust us, and enjoy.",
