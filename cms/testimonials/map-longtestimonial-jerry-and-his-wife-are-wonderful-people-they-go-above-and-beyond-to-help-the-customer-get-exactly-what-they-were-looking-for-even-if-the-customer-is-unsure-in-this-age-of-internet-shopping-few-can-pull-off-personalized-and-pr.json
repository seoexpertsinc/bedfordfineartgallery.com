  "longTestimonial": "Jerry and his wife are wonderful people. They go above and beyond to help the customer get exactly what they were looking for, even if the customer is unsure. In this age of internet shopping, few can pull off personalized and professional customer service, but Bedford Fine Art Gallery has perfected it! Very responsive and no nonsense with true knowledge on all of their paintings. Shipped safely and fast, Iâ€™m deciding on my next painting and would trust nobody more.",
