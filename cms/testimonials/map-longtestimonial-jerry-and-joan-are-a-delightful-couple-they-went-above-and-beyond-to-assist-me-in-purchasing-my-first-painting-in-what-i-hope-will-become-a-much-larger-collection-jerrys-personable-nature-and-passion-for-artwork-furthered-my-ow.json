  "longTestimonial": "Jerry and Joan are a delightful couple. They went above and beyond to assist me in purchasing my first painting in what I hope will become a much larger collection. Jerry's personable nature and passion for artwork furthered my own interest in acquiring a painting which evoked a deep emotional connection. In sum, Bedford Fine Art Gallery is an exceptional art gallery which fosters meaningful relationships based on mutual respect, trust, and an appreciation for the field of art history. I highly recommend Bedford Fine Art Gallery and I look forward to forging a lasting relationship with Jerry and Joan for years to come.",
