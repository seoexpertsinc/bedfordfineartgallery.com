  "longTestimonial": "Recently I purchased a painting for my birthday. I found it as posted on Instagram. Upon further inspection the painting was by the son of the architect that designed my house. How happy I was to find that Bedford fine Art Gallery had not sold the piece. Furthermore after discussing its acquisition with Joan not only did I find the entire process most pleasant but Joan agreed to deliver the painting the very next day which was in fact my birthday. I find this sort of old-fashioned business courtesy so rare these days. What a pleasure to do business with people like this! I wholeheartedly recommend art purchases from this company! They are simply the best!",
