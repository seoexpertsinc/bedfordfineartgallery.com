  "longTestimonial": "My wife is an artist, and I am a financial advisor, different in many ways. My bride has always desired a collection in fine art. My fear has always been the numbers, what am I paying for, is there an investment value, and is it a fair value? A single customer with two very different views on why to buy art. Jerry and Joan are simply amazing. Their knowledge and passion are second to none. Not only is the collection at Bedford Fine Art Gallery of museum quality, but their passion really inspires you, comforts you, and welcomes you in as a member of what seems like an exclusive club. We are blessed to know them. They will work with you in every way possible to make your dream come true. Our life is now more beautiful because of them, and we look forward to our next purchase.",
