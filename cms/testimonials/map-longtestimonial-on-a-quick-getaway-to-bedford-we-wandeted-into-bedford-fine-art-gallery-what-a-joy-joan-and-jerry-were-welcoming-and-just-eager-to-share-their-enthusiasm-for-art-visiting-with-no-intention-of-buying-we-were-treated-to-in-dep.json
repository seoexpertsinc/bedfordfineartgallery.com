  "longTestimonial": "On a quick getaway to Bedford, we wandeted into Bedford fine Art Gallery. What a joy! Joan and Jerry were welcoming and just eager to share their enthusiasm for art. Visiting with no intention of buying, we were treated to in depth information on each artist and piece that caught our attention. We untimately purchased two pieces that touched us. Art speaks to everyone differently and it is nice to have gallery owners who appreciate that.",
