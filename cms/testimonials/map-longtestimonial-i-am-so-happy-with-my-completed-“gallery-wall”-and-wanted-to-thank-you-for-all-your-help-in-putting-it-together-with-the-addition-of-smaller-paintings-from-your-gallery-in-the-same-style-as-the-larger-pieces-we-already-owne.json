  "longTestimonial": "I am so happy with my completed “gallery wall” and wanted to thank you for all your help in putting it together. With the addition of smaller paintings from your gallery, in the same style as the larger pieces we already owned, we were able to create a montage of landscapes with a “local scalp level feel” which is cohesive and beautiful. After talking with you and sending photos of the pictures we wanted to work around, you were able to suggest both vertical and horizontal pieces of various sizes which would work in our mix. When my husband and I visited your gallery, we were both pleasantly surprised by the number and variety of beautiful paintings available. You and Joan had already identified the paintings most likely to work for us and it was difficult to choose! Now that the installation Is complete, we couldn’t be happier and look forward to visiting you again when the “art” bug hits.",
