  "longTestimonial": "Jerry and Joan were a constant pleasure to work with. I had been considering purchasing a presidential portrait of theirs for some time, but they never tired of my questions or repeated requests to see the painting. Jerry was especially knowledgeable of the artist, the painting, and its provenance. As this purchase was my first real art acquisition, Jerry helped me not only understand the history of the piece but also how it was evaluated and appraised. I hope to acquire more 20th and 19th century oil paintings in the future and will certainly keep my eye on the Bedford Fine Art Gallery.",
