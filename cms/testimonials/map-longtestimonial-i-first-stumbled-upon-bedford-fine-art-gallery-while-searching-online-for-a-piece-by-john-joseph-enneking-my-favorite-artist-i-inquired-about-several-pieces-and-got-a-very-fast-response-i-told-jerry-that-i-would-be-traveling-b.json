  "longTestimonial": "I first stumbled upon Bedford Fine Art Gallery while searching online for a piece by John Joseph Enneking, my favorite artist. I inquired about several pieces and got a very fast response. I told Jerry that I would be traveling by Bedford Fine Art Gallery the next day and would love to stop in to see the pieces. When I arrived, Jerry and his wife Joan were very welcoming and did not hesitate to show me their incredible collection in addition to the pieces that I was interested in. They were both very knowledgeable and truly care about each and every piece that they own. Ultimately, I was able to take home my very first John Joseph Enneking piece, Woodland Whitewater, and I could not be happier with both the piece and my entire experience at Bedford Fine Art gallery. I hope to do business with both Jerry and Joan again in the near future.",
