  "longTestimonial": "It was such a pleasure to purchase artwork from Jerry. He is an honest man, who goes the extra mile (literally – he actually delivered a painting to me, over 6 hour drive one way!) to make sure the painting arrived safely. He is reasonable, knowledgeable, and provides outstanding value and quality with every transaction. I highly recommend Jerry Hawk and Bedford Fine Art Gallery.",
