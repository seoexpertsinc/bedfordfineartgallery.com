  "longTestimonial": "Bedford PA! An American historical time capsule. Bedford was an 18th century British military fortification and afterwards a 19th century Federal period frontier gateway to the Northwest Territory and is today a popular tourist destination. Joan and Jerry Hawk’s Bedford Fine Art Gallery, located in the historic Bedford Mansion, near the Bedford Courthouse, offers an extensive collection of original 19th century paintings in their beautifully restored gallery...which continually attracts this appreciative collector and former museum trustee.",
