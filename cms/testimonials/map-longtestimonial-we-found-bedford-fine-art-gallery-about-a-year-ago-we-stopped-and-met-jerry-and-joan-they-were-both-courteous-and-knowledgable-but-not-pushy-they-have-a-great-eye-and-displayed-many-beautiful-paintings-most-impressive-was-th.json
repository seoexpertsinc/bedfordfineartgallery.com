  "longTestimonial": "We found Bedford Fine Art Gallery about a year ago. We stopped and met Jerry and Joan. They were both courteous and knowledgable, but not pushy. They have a great eye and displayed many beautiful paintings. Most impressive was the level of customer service they bring to the table. They went out of their way to be as helpful and accommodating as possible. We bought a wonderful painting we love.",
