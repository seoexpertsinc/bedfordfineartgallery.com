  "longTestimonial": "On a recent trip to Bedford we visited the Fine Art Gallery and were impressed by the quality of the paintings displayed and by the discussions we had with Jerry. We purchased a painting and we expect to revisit the Gallery on our next trip to Bedford. Stop by; the Hawks will be happy to spend time with you and you will learn some history of the area from them. Highly recommended.",
