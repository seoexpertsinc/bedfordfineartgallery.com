  "longTestimonial": "Bedford Fine Art Gallery..... the experience for me was all positive. I was searching for various artists from the 19th century that lived in and painted Pennsylvania, which lead me to Bedford PA. Its a pleasure to find such a collection of paintings in a historic atmosphere where background classical music plays.... the lighting shines on each piece perfectly.... and you have details of the artist to make the painting more personal. Jerry and Joan have a business model that works.... they care about your experience at the gallery.... and most important they care about the quality of each painting. If you are able to visit the gallery I would suggest giving a few hours to enjoy the artwork. One more tip.... if your satisfied how the paintings look online, they are much better in person. I know I'll be back in Bedford soon to purchase another!",
