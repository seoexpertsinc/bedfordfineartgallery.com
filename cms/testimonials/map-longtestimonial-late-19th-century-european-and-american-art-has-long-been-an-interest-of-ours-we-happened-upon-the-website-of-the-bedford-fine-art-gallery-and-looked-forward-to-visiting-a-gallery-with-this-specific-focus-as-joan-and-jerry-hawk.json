  "longTestimonial": "Late 19th century European and American art has long been an interest of ours. We happened upon the website of the Bedford Fine Art Gallery and looked forward to visiting a gallery with this specific focus. As Joan and Jerry Hawk met us at the door and we stepped in, we saw rooms filled with the art we admire and we could tell it was going to be a good day.\n\nThe rooms are wonderfully displayed with oil and watercolor paintings and graphite drawings. Art gallery labels, noting background information on the artist and the individual piece, are most helpful. Additionally, the Hawks have made large notebooks with more extensive information on each piece and the artist. It is easy to tell the Hawks love what they do and they willingly share their knowledge. They even demonstrated lighting techniques for a pictureâ€™s best presentation.\n\nWe will undoubtedly visit again to see the art in this remarkable gallery. We brought home a watercolor and have the confidence we were dealt with openly and fairly.",
