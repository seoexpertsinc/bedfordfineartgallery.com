  "longTestimonial": "The Bedford Fine Art Gallery was recommended to us by our neighbors. They were very impressed both by the wonderful artwork presented and the very amiable owners. So, one rainy day, we stopped in to see for ourselves. We are so glad we did! It was immediately evident that, for Jerry and Joan, the gallery was not a business but a passion. Their vocation, as geologists, has prepared them for the exacting work they do in collecting and displaying fine 18th, 19th, and 20th century artwork by recognized artists of the respective periods. Jerry and Joan allow the visitor to wander, at leisure, through three floors of paintings worthy of any fine home where art of this caliber is appreciated. Although there is no pressure at all while viewing, both Jerry and Joan are willing and able to give full background information on art and artist, making our visit not only a pleasurable artistic adventure but an education as well. We were taken by both the art and the gallery owners. We actually did make a purchase that fits so well in our early 20th century home and, we must say, the price was exceptional. If we can act as your neighbors and recommend a very pleasing gallery experience, please take a rainy day, or any day, and go visit with Jerry and Joan. You wonâ€™t regret it. We might even see you there!",
