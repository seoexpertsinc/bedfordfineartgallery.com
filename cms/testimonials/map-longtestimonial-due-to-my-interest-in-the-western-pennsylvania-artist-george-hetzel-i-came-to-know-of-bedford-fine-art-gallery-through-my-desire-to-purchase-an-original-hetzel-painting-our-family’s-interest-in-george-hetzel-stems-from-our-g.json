  "longTestimonial": "Due to my interest in the Western Pennsylvania artist, George Hetzel, I came to know of Bedford Fine Art Gallery through my desire to purchase an original Hetzel painting. Our family’s interest in George Hetzel stems from our grandfather, Charles Succop, who took art lessons in Pittsburgh with Hetzel. When a Hetzel painting became available and after I informed Jerry Hawk of our family’s connection to Hetzel, he made it possible for me to make the purchase through a short but much needed payment plan. Without such consideration, I would not have the Hetzel we enjoy today. I recommend BFAG to both the serious art collector and to the one who desires to cultivate a love for fine art. The Hawks are knowledgeable and accommodating, and their love for fine art goes far beyond making a sale.",
