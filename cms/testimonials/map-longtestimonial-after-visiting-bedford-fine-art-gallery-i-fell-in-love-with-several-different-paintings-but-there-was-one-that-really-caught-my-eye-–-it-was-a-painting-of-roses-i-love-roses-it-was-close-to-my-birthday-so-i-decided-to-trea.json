  "longTestimonial": "After visiting Bedford Fine Art Gallery, I fell in love with several different paintings. But there was one that really caught my eye â€“ it was a painting of roses. I love roses. It was close to my birthday, so I decided to treat myself. Jerry and Joan were honest and straightforward with me. Also, they made the sale easy and fair.",
