  "longTestimonial": "If I could give more than 5 starts to Bedford Fine Art Gallery, I would. Dealing with Jerry Hawk was timely, efficient and productive. He posted an excellent photo of a painting by Mary Hiester Reid. It was true to the condition of the work. He responded immediately to my inquiry, he took a great deal of time with me as he described the work, and he discussed price openly and honestly. His terms made it possible for me to buy it, and he collaborated with a local shipping outfit to pack and send the painting as well. (It was beautifully and securely packed.) I recommend Bedford Fine Art Gallery without reservation!",
