  "longTestimonial": "We visited the Bedford Fine Art Gallery by chance during a short break at Bedford Springs. Joan made us extremely welcome on that first visit and we were very taken with the work of two artists. We returned the next day and enjoyed a relaxed opportunity to study the pictures again before we committed to purchase. Both Joan and Jerry were very knowledgeable and helpful but also allowed us some privacy to discuss the pictures ourselves. Once we committed to purchase they went \"the extra mile\" to help overcome obvious hurdles of packing for international shipping and the customs arrangements. A couple of weeks later both pictures arrived safely at our home in Scotland and we are now starting to enjoy them.",
