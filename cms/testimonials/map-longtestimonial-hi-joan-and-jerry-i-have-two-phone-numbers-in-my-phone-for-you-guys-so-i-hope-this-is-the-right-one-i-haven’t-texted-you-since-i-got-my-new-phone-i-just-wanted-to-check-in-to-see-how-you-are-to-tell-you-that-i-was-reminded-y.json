  "longTestimonial": "Hi Joan and Jerry! I have two phone numbers in my phone for you guys so I hope this is the right one. I haven’t texted you since I got my new phone. I just wanted to check in to see how you are to tell you that I was reminded yesterday of what an awesome business you guys have going. I went to one of the other galleries that has some of my artwork, and the person that I was dealing with no longer works there. Everything was mass chaos, and they can’t find one of my paintings! Jeff and I already knew that we found a gem when we found your gallery but then we got to spend time with you in December and it was doubly confirmed! Thank you again for letting us be a part of your beautiful Gallery.",
