  "longTestimonial": "Over the past several years I have had the enjoyment of acquiring a fairly substantial number of 19th century paintings from Joan and Jerry Hawk of Bedford Fine Art Gallery. Each work is special and fills a very high quality niche in each room. From Scalp Level to Hudson River School the works have added and raised the bar in our collection and made our home a wonderful place to enjoy each painting individually and as a group. We have counted on the Hawks over the years to regularly discover incredible items whose quality and condition have ameliorated the artistic environment of our homes.",
