  "longTestimonial": "My first visit to the Bedford Fine Arts Gallery was a pleasure. The Galleryâ€™s setting is a charming historic home which in itself is worth the visit, but it is easy to lose your sense of time as you move through the spaces and are surrounded by an impressive quantity and variety of beautifully preserved artwork. Jerry and Joan Hawk have an extensive knowledge of the artists, backgrounds, and artwork in their gallery that they love to share with guests . The time invested in the Bedford Fine Arts Gallery will be one of your most pleasant memories of the year.",
