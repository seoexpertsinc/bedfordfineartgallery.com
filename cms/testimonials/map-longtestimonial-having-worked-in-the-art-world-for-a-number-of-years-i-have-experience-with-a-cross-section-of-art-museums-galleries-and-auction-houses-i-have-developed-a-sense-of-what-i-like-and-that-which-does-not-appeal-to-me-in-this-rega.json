  "longTestimonial": "Having worked in the art world for a number of years, I have experience with a cross section of art museums, galleries and auction houses. I have developed a sense of what I like and that which does not appeal to me. In this regard, my recent interaction with the Bedford Fine Art Gallery prompts this unsolicited testimonial. From my perspective, the Bedford Fine Art Gallery would be the envy of many urban museums and art galleries.\n\nProprietors Joan and Jerry Hawk have established a first class art gallery offering the very best in fine art, professionally arranged displays, state-of-the-art technology, and superior customer service. Joan and Jerry have a good eye and the quality of their artwork is reminiscent of that seen in the very best art museums. Together, they have discovered and conserved a number of art treasures that I am sure would appeal to the most discriminating of collectors. Each piece is well researched and the didactic material provides good insight to the artist and the artwork. You can browse their inventory on a leisurely walk through the Bedford Fine Art Gallery; or page through the Gallery catalogue; or visit the on-site kiosk for information; or go on line at BedfordFineArtGallery.com.\n\nIf you are interested in acquiring good quality fine art, I recommend that you visit the Bedford Fine Art Gallery at 230 South Juliana Street in Bedford, PA and let Joan and Jerry Hawk be your personal guides to fine art.",
