  "longTestimonial": "Let’s face it, paintings are expensive, and it can be a traumatic experience buying them. Jerry and Joan do as much as any vendor possibly could do to make the experience relaxed, warm, and joyful. We came away with a high level of trust and satisfaction, knowing that we got a square deal on some wonderful paintings and knowing that Jerry and Joan provide great customer support. Finally, we came away smiling because they are such great folks and a whole lot of fun to know!",
