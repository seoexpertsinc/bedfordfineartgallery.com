  "longTestimonial": "As a fellow enthusiast in the trade, I was delighted to find a work in my area of interest from Bedford Gallery. Jerry & Joan offered the work fully restored and framed so it was ready to hang. They were easy to deal with which went a long way since I was buying from outside the US. It was also cool to learn more about their interest in Western PA historical art which I knew very little about. I will have to keep an eye on their website to see what else they turn up.",
