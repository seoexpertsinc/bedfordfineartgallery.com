  "longTestimonial": "It was love at first sight when I walked into Bedford Fine Art Gallery for the first time and saw the painting by Auguste Toulmouche. Every time I visited the gallery I made sure to visit my favorite painting. Jerry and Joan would delight in telling me about the artist which made me appreciate the portrait even more. I am thrilled with my purchase and cannot thank the Hawk’s enough for their exceptional customer service, and knowledge of the artist's paintings they carry in their gallery.",
