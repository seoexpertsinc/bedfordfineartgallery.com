  "longTestimonial": "We met Jerry and Joan Hawk shortly after they returned to Bedford as full time residents to open the gallery. Their knowledge of 19 th century art is extensive and the variety of paintings on display is impressive for any area. The paintings are displayed with museum quality lighting over two floors in the gallery. In recent years, they have added different genres of paintings, and this last Christmas I chose a more modern floral water color, by Michael Struber, for my wife. If you are considering a wall art purchase to decorate your home, we would highly recommend contacting The Fine Art Gallery. We look forward to seeing what new pieces will be added in the newly expanded lower level of the gallery.",
