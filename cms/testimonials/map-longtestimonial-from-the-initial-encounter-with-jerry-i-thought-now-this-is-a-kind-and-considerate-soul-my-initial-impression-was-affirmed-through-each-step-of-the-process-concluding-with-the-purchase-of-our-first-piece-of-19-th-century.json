  "longTestimonial": "From the initial encounter with Jerry I thought, \"Now, this is a kind and considerate soul.\" My initial impression was affirmed through each step of the process, concluding with the purchase of our first piece of 19 th century artwork! Never once did I feel pressured nor was the conversation forced. Jerry readily conveys his passion for and knowledge of the masterful works from this wonderful period in art history. If art speaks, then Jerry ably facilitates the conversation! From the first call through receipt of the expertly packaged artwork, the Bedford Fine Art Gallery excels!",
