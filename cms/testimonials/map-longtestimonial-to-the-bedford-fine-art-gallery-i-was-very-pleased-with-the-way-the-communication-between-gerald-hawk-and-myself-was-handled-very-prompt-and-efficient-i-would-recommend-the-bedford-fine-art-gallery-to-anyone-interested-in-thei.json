  "longTestimonial": "To the Bedford Fine Art Gallery. I was very pleased with the way the communication between Gerald Hawk and myself was handled. Very prompt and efficient. I would recommend the Bedford Fine Art Gallery to anyone interested in their beautiful artwork. Also if they have any antique artwork they are interested in selling. Thank you so much for taking the time and interest in my pencil sketches!",
