  "longTestimonial": "A visit to the Bedford Fine Arts Gallery is a rare opportunity to see American nineteenth landscape, portrait, and still life paintings in a house-turned-gallery of the same era, in a region close to where some of the artists, such as The Scalp Level School, painted. The collection also includes contemporary paintings as well. Owners, collectors and curators Joan and Jerry Hawk are knowledgeable not just about the art they collect and sell, but about the geology that created the terrain the artists depicted.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Joan showed me through all three levels of the remarkable gallery. She first knew the house, known as The Barclay House, as a child when it served as the Bedford Public Library. Years later she and Jerry returned to Bedford, purchased the house and have restored it to serve as both their gallery and home. As we walked from room to room Joan told me both about the individual paintings and artists, and about the house, making the tour a double pleasure and an informal art and architecture history lesson as well.\n\nDonâ€™t miss the beautiful views of Bedford from the second-floor gallery rooms, and the awesome stone foundation of the lower-level gallery-conference room. The artwork is beautiful, the hospitality personal and informative. The Bedford Fine Arts Gallery is an enjoyable, inspiring place to visit, well worth a stop while you are exploring historic downtown Bedford.",
