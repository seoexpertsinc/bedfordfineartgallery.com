  "longTestimonial": "It’s not every day you meet people so kind, professional and passionate about what they do. Every part of the buying process was outstanding. Every detail was taken care of from the excellent online listing to perfectly handled packing and shipping once we completed the purchase. We were so intrigued after we first talked with Jerry about the piece which we finally bought that we had to make a trip to Bedford to meet Jerry and Joan in person. It was well worth it. Whether your trip to Bedford is 10 miles or 2000 miles, make the journey. There’s great art and outstanding gallery owners waiting for you.",
