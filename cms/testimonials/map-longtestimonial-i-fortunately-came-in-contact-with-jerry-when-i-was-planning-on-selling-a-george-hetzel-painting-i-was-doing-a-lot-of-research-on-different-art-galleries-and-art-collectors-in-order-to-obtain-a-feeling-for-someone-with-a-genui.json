  "longTestimonial": "I, fortunately, came in contact with Jerry when I was planning on selling a George Hetzel painting. I was doing a lot of research on different art galleries and art collectors in order to obtain a feeling for someone with a genuine expertise on Hetzel paintings. So, I came upon the Bedford Fine Art Gallery and I reached out to Jerry, since the gallery did mention experience and expertise in 19th century artwork; and it was close in proximity to where I live. After speaking with Jerry several times, I felt very comfortable and confident he would be the best to make a sale with. Upon meeting both Jerry and Joan I knew I made the right decision. They are very passionate about art work and quite knowledgeable on the life and history of the artist. It was a pleasure doing business with them and I would highly recommend the Bedford Fine Art Gallery if you are looking for fairness, honesty and a genuine comfort level in either selling or purchasing fine art.",
