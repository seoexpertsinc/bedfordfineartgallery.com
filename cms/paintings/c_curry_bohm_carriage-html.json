   "body" : "Claude Curry Bohm was born in Nashville, Tennessee and first studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City with Edward F. Timmons.  He moved to Chicago and enrolled at the Chicago Art Institute and joined the group of working artists at the Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Art.  Bohm and his wife first visited Peaceful Valley, at Nashville, in Brown County, Indiana in 1920 where a group of artists had settled to form the Brown County Art Colony.  The Bohms returned there every summer for 11 years and In 1926 Bohm became charter member of the Brown County Art Gallery Association.  Finally in 1932 they decided to make Nashville home; however his wife remained and worked in Chicago for a couple of years to provide a financial cushion until he had established himself in Nashville.  Their first “residence” was a converted cow barn.  Later he bought a farm on Greasy Creek—the barn on the property was the subject of one of his paintings which he sold and he thus considered the barn “lucky”. During World War II Bohm worked for General Motors to support the American war effort.  Bohm had become a successful artist, teaching students during the summer, going to Gloucester, Massachusetts in the fall, and returning to Nashville to paint winter landscapes, which were to become a favorite among his patrons.  In 1947 the Bohms bought a home in Nashville and had the “lucky barn” moved and rebuilt there to use as his studio.  In his painting Early Monday Morning Bohm had said “the problem of the landscape painter is not to paint the subject as it is in Nature but to interpret his emotion of the subject”.  This description could be applied to much his other works as well.  Bohm was a member of the Chicago Painters and Sculptors Association; Chicago Palette and Chisel; Brown County Art Gallery Association (Brown County Art Guild); Indiana Hoosier Salon (Indianapolis); the Indiana Artists’ Club;Rockport Art Association (MA); and North Shore Art Association, Gloucester, MA).  Bohm exhibited at the Municipal Art League of Chicago (prize); Palette and Chisel (1931, gold medal); Brown County Art Gallery (Frederick N. Vance Memorial Award); Hoosier Salon (Edward Rector Memorial Award; Lawrence A. Downs Prize; Tri Kappa Purchase Prize; Daughters of Indiana Award; Summer Landscape Prize); Golden Gate International Exposition (San Francisco, 1940, bronze medal); and Indiana Artists’ Club (1945, prize).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
