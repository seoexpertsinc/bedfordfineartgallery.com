  "body": "Clarence Drew Bartlett was a painter of landscapes and still-lifes and portraits. One of his finer portraits is that of Benjamin Franklin, modeled after the one painted by J.S. Duplessis, a French portraitist. It was Duplessis’s portrait of Franklin that is reproduced on the U.S. hundred dollar bill. Bartlett’s still-lifes deviate from the “normal” paintings of fruit and flowers and incorporated such commonplace items as newspapers, bottles, pipes, and candles.  ",
