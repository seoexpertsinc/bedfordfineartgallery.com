   "body" : "Brackett was a Boston, Massachusetts artist, the son of noted fish and game still life artist Walter L. Brackett and nephew of sculptor Edward A. Brackett.  Brackett was a painter of nautical and aquatic themes, and like his father, painted realistic compositions depicting game, popular among sporting people.  Brackett was a member of the Boston Art Club, where he exhibited his works.  He is included in âThe Artists Bluebookâ (Dunbier, 2005) and âWho was Who in American Artâ (Falk, 1999).  His art has been sold through such venues as Copely Fine Art Auctions, Eldredâs, and Skinnerâs, Inc.  This simple depiction of a woodcock illustrates a subtle trompe lâoeil effect with the tack and string from which the quarry is suspended.",
