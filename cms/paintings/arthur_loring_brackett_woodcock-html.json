   "body" : "Brackett was a Boston, Massachusetts artist, the son of noted fish and game still life artist Walter L. Brackett and nephew of sculptor Edward A. Brackett.  Brackett was a painter of nautical and aquatic themes, and like his father, painted realistic compositions depicting game, popular among sporting people.  Brackett was a member of the Boston Art Club, where he exhibited his works.  He is included in “The Artists Bluebook” (Dunbier, 2005) and “Who was Who in American Art” (Falk, 1999).  His art has been sold through such venues as Copely Fine Art Auctions, Eldred’s, and Skinner’s, Inc.  This simple depiction of a woodcock illustrates a subtle trompe l’oeil effect with the tack and string from which the quarry is suspended.",
