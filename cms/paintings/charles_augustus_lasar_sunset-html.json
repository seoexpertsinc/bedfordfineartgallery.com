   "body" : "Charles Augustus Lasar, known as âShorty" Lasar was a Johnstown, Pennsylvania-born artist.  As did many American artists, he travelled to Paris to broaden his art education.  He studied under painter-sculptor Jean-Leon Gerome, who also taught Pennsylvania-born artists Mary Cassatt and Thomas Eakins.  Lasar's draftsmanship became legendary during his tenure at Jean-Leon Gerome's atelier.  After several years of successful exhibitions, Lasar opened his own atelier, which catered to English-speaking female artists.  Cecilia Beaux, considered the finest woman painter at the turn of the last century and a friend of âShorty's", described him as âa funny little man with intensely bright eyes and dark hair, standing aroundâand his legs about two feet long".  Beaux felt that Shorty's lessons were too technical; she preferred a more intuitive approach to painting.  However, she observed that Shorty's student clung to his strictures as if to a lifeline.",
