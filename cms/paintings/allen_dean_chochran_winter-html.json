   "body" : "Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cochran moved to Woodstock, New York and became a member of the early 20th century âutopianâ Byrdcliffe Art Colony there. He took instruction from tonalist painter, Birge Harrison and Kenyon Cox.  Cochran adopted the tonalist style of the colony; however, it is his crisp, frosty snow scenes, such as âWinter Landscapeâ for which he was to become best known.  A nexus of the tenets of John Ruskinâs âtruth to natureâ and the American arts and crafts movement of the early 20th century, his landscapes are a significant contribution to early 20th century American plein painting. Cochran was a member of the Woodstock Artists Association and the Salmagundi Club (NYC). He exhibited at the National Academy of Design, The Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C); the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His works were highly sought after by the emerging Victorian upper-middle class, who had the means and were eager to bring exquisite fine art into their new homes.  He was the source of inspiration to other artists including Bryant Chapin, John Clinton Spencer, Charles Storer and George Whitaker.  He was member of the Boston and Providence art clubs, where he exhibited, and the Providence Press Club.  Leavitt also exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York City, the Boston Art Club and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $22,705.",
