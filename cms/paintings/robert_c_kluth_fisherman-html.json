  "body": "Kluth, known as a marine and landscape painter, was born in Macklenburg-Schwerin, Germany in 1854. In 1861 he immigrated to America with his parents, where he spent his childhood at Fishkill-on-the- Hudson. Kluth first studied art in America and trained as a lithographer—one of his lithographs was published by Currier & Ives. Lithography, however, was only a means to acquire the necessary funding to support his European training. He studied in Dusseldorf, Germany and often traveled to Norway to sketch. Although marine landscapes dominated Kluth’s career, he believed that the practice of painting still-lifes was an important component of an artist’s technical training and he continued to paint them throughout his life. This painting shows another facet of his oeuvre -- a landscape with a figure. He spent most of his life in Brooklyn, New York. He exhibited at the New York National Academy of Design, the Philadelphia Academy of the Fine Arts, Boston Art Club, and the Brooklyn Society of Artists, the latter of which he was a founder. Many of Kluth’s paintings of Norwegian fjords were purchased by Pittsburgh industrialist, Andrew Carnegie, for display in public museums and libraries.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $10,362.",
