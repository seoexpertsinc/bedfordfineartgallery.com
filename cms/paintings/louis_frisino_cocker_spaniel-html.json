   "body" : "Born in Baltimore, Maryland Frisino graduated from the Maryland School for the Deaf in Frederick Maryland and in 1953 graduated with honors from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), where he received the George Peabody award.  Frisino applied for work in the commercial art department at the former Baltimore News-Post and Sunday America, later known as The News American (now defunct).  He was reluctantly given a position in the art department; however, his boss and art director recognized his talent encouraged him to pursue additional study.  Frisino created advertisements for local department stores and other retailers. He left the newspaper in 1978 to pursue a full-time career in wildlife art.  Frisinoâs ability to capture wildlife so realistically resulted in numerous awards.  He received first place honors in Maryland Duck Stamp competitions (1976-77; 1986-87; 1993-94); Trout Stamp competitions (1977, 1978 and 1979); and the North Carolina Sportsman License Stamp competition (1987).  Other honors included: National Turkey Federation competition (1977); Ward Foundation World Championship Wildfowl Painting competition (1987, Salisbury, MD); New Jersey Duck Stamp (1987); North Carolina Duck Stamp (1988); North Dakota Salmon and Trout Stamp (1989); North Carolina Duck Stamp (1989); Alaska Duck Stamp (1990); West Virginia Duck Stamp (1990); and the Oregon Waterfowl stamp (1991). He received second place honors in the National Turkey Federation competition (1977).\r\n",
