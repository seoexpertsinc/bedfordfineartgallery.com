   "body" : "Robert M. Tudor was a Pennsylvania artist who is best known for his landscape paintings; however, he also painted genre scenes and soldiers.  Tudor worked in Philadelphia from 1858 to 1869 and exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  Tudor is referenced in âWho was Who in American Art 1564 â 1975â (Falk, Ed., 1999) and the New York Historical Society's âDictionary of Artists in Americaâ (1957).  While âGoing Fishingâ itself is a wonderful combination landscape/genre painting representative of the era, the frame is outstanding in its visual impact and craftsmanship.  The cantilever aspect of the frame is rather unique to the typical framing style of the 19th Century.  The metallic leaf is stenciled with a rustic pattern designed to resemble rocks, a perfect frame for a fishing scene along the rocky stream bank.",
