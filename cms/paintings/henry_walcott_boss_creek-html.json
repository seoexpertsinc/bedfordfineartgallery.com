   "body" : "Born in Fabius, Onondaga County, NY; very little is known of his life. He married Maria M. Matteson of\r\nPratts Hollow, NY, ~25 miles northeast of Fabius, in 1847. It seems that he started his painting career\r\nlate, as no information is available that he was painting at this time. Sometime after their marriage, the\r\ncouple moved to Binghamton, NY --it is known that Boss operated a music store there during the 1850s\r\nuntil ca. 1863. In 1864, Owen joined his brothers in an ink manufacturing business in Binghamton. Their\r\nink was awarded a diploma and silver medal by the New York State Fair in 1863, but the firm was no\r\nlonger in business by ca 1867. Is it this time that Boss pursued painting full-time? Boss knew the crews\r\nof the Delaware & Hudson Railway (D & H), which ran from the anthracite fields of Pennsylvania through\r\nBinghamton, the northeastern states and into Canada. These friendships provided him with a bonus --\r\nhe often got free rides, which took him into the areas around Lake George, Glen Falls, the Finger Lakes\r\nregion, Hudson River, and Franconia Notch in the White Mountains (NH) among other stops along the\r\nline. There is no record of where he received his art training, but it is likely he had some – perhaps from\r\nthe noted landscape artists of the time, which he would have had the opportunity to meet, and possibly\r\npaint with, on his D & H excursions. Boss painted in the style of the Hudson River School artists, so it is\r\nlikely he knew at least some of them. There is no doubt that he was well-received – he was invited to\r\nexhibit at the National Academy of Design, a venue whose members were elected by their peers.\r\n\r\n",
