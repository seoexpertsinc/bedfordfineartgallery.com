   "body" : "Ripley was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Although he was an accomplished pianist and tuba-player, Ripley decided to follow a path in art. His first study was at the Fenway School of Illustration in Boston. In 1917 Ripley enlisted in the U.S. Army and served with General Pershing’s Allied Expeditionary Force in France. After the war, Ripley studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Art with Philip Hale and Frank Benson (1919 to 1924) and in 1919 he moved to Lexington, Massachusetts where he opened his studio and painted landscapes and portraits. In 1924 he was awarded the Paige Travelling Fellowship, which allowed him to study in Europe and Africa. In 1926 he exhibited his European paintings, done during his travels, at a solo exhibition at the Guild of Boston Artists and in summer of 1927 he traveled to Scandinavia. He taught at the Harvard School of Architecture in Cambridge, MA, in 1929. During the Great Depression during the 1930s Ripley, an avid sportsman, focused more sporting scenes—upland game and water fowl hunting and flyfishing with which he found great success. In 1939, Ripley received a large commission from the federal government’s Federal Art Project (FAP) of the Works Progress Administration for a mural in the Lexington Post Office. This was followed by a commission to paint a mural depicting the life of Paul Revere for the Winchester Public Library, and another for the Paul Revere Insurance Company (Worcester, MA) to complete 14 paintings also depicting the life of Paul Revere. In 1936 Ripley became associated with Sportsman's Gallery of Art and Books in New York City, who would sponsor him on hunting/painting trips to upper New England during summer/autumn, and to Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina in the winter. By the 1940s Ripley was one of the premiere sporting art watercolorists in the United States. Ripley provided illustrations for sporting book publisher, Derrydale Press during the 1930s and 1940s, followed by the selection of his drypoint, “American Widgeon,” for the Federal Duck Stamp for the year 1942 - 1943. In 1942 Ripley’s solo exhibition of his sporting oils and watercolors at the Guild of Boston Artists, resulted in his switching solely to sporting and wildlife as subjects for his printmaking. 1930s and 1940s movie actor Robert Montgomery commissioned Ripley to paint scenes of him hunting with his dogs; one of which depicts Montgomery and his friend, movie icon, James Cagney on a pheasant shoot.  In 1965 his 14 paintings on the life of Revolutionary War hero, Paul Revere, were exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum. Ripley was a member of National Academy of Design; Audubon Artists; National Society of Mural Painters; Guild of Boston Artists (1926, pres., 1959-60); American Watercolor Society; and the Boston Watercolor Society of Painters. He exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago (1926, Logan Prize for watercolor, 1927-32, 1934-45, 1936-prize and medal); Guild of Boston Artists (1926, solo foreign scene paintings, 1930, solo sporting paintings, 1942, 1972 commemorative, 1974 Boston paintings, 1975 foreign scene paintings, 1978); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1928, 1930, 1936-37, 1939, 1945); Boston Watercolor Society (1929, prize; Boston Art Club (1939, prize; Boston Tercentenary Exhibition (1930, medal); AWCS (1939-58, prizes, medal, 1945, 1947, 1952, 1954); New York Watercolor Club (1933, Obrig prize); Toledo Museum of Art (1938); Boston Museum of Fine Art (1938); Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, MA, 1939); New York World’s Fair (1939); Worcester Museum of Art (1940); Baltimore Water Color Society (1940-42); Metropolitan Museum of Art (1942); New Jersey State Museum (Trenton); Currier Gallery of Art; Boston Society of Watercolor Painters; Grand Gallery (solo 1949); American Artist Magazine (1952, prize); National Academy of Design (1953, prize, 1964, Mason prize); American Artists Professional League (1954, gold medal, 1955, prize, 1959); Boston Art Festival ( 1955, prize); Allied Artists of America (1957, prize); Concord Art Association ( 1955, prize and medal); Jordan Marsh (1955, prize and medal, 1958, 1961); and Worcester Art Museum (1965, Paul Revere historical paintings).\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $97,750.",
