  "body": "Morris lived in Mansfield, Ohio, but was active in New York, Maine, Connecticut Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. as well.  As a youth Morris spent some time in the western United States and western panoramas and mountain paintings comprised his earliest works.  He was largely self-taught, but with natural skill, a keen eye, and under the influence of early 20th century American Impressionism, Morris produced many wonderful paintings including the gardens at Kingwood Center in Mansfield; the Krohn Conservatory in Cincinnati (OH); the steel mills along the Ohio River and snowy New York City street scenes.  Morris exhibited at the Vixsebose Gallery (Cleveland, OH); Cincinnati Art Galleries; Cooley Gallery (Old Lyme, CT); Griffith Gallery (Pittsburg, PA); and Swain Galleries (Morristown, NJ). ",
