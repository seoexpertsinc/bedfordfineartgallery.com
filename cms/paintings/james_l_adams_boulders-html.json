   "body" : "Adams was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England to a carver and gilder.  This is very little biographical information currently available; however, it is known that he maintained residence in Leeds at one point in his career.  Census records from 1871 and 1871 list him as a landscape painter/artist in Leeds; however, by 1891, he had moved to Manningham, also in West Yorkshire, where he is listed as a lithographic designer.  Adams is documented at having exhibited at The Royal Academy and The Royal Society of British Artists between 1874 and 1890.  Further documentation on Adams as an artist can be found in The Dictionary of British Artists (1976, Johnson and Greutzer), The Dictionary of Victorian Painters (Wood, 1972) and Painters in the Northern Counties of England and Wales (Child, 1994).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
