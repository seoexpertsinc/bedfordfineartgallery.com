   "body" : "Lila Hetzel was the daughter of George Hetzel, the famous landscapist and founder of the Scalp Level Movement. She studied art at the Pittsburgh School of Design under D. B Walkley, a New England landscapist, and Martin B. Leisser, a Scalp Level artist. She traveled to Europe where she studied the Old Masters, where she was influenced by Rembrandt’s use of light, Rueben’s color and Michelangelo’s force. Her own works illustrate that balance and design in a composition are as important as color. She painted alongside her father at the Hetzel Studio in Somerset, Pennsylvania. She later moved to Pittsburgh, where she opened a studio and became a charter member of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh. Although Lila lived in Pittsburgh, later in life, she would return to the studio in Somerset where she stayed and painted much of the year, returning to Pittsburgh only during the winter.\n\nDuring this time, she created a series of interior paintings of the Hetzel Studio, titled “Old Fashioned Corners”. She exhibited at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh Playhouse, Arts and Crafts Center of Pittsburgh, Gillespie Galleries, Westmoreland County Museum of Art, and Jennerstown Art Gallery. Other exhibitions, including one-woman shows were held in Somerset, Ligonier and Indiana, Pennsylvania..",
