  "body": "Born Antonius Johannes Thieme in Rotterdam, Netherlands, he was sent to naval school by his parents in an attempt to discourage any notion of his pursuit of an art career.  Thieme thought otherwise and at the age of 14 was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Rotterdam from to 1902-1904, and at the Royal Academy at The Hague in 1905.  In 1905, youthful wanderlust and a strong desire to study art, still against his parentâ€™s will, led him to Dusseldorf, Germany where he worked as an apprentice artist to stage designer, George Hoecker.  Circa 1907, Thieme traveled to Switzerland, then to Turin, Italy, where he worked as a stage designer until 1909, when he enrolled in the Scuola di Belle Arti.  In 1910 he moved to Naples, Italy to sketch and paint, followed by travel to London, England in 1912.  In 1917, he traveled to the United States and settled in New York City and soon received a commission as a set designer for the famous Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova, at the Century Theater.  Theime left for South America following the end of the commission, earning his way with stage design, followed by a return to Europe, working in England, France and Italy.  A return to the United States in 1919 found him in Boston, Massachusetts, designing stages for the Copley Theater.  Finally in 1928, Thieme ceased stage set design and focused on his painting and etching, setting up a studio in Copley Square.  After his marriage in 1927, he moved to the art colony at Rockport, on Cape Ann in Massachusetts, a haven for American en plein air Impressionist painters.  Thieme concentrated on painting seascapes and shore scenes, adopting the Impressionist style but including the influence of the Dutch tradition.  Known as \"Master of Light and Shadow\" for the attention he paid to capturing on his canvases the effects of light on water, he directed the Thieme Summer School of Art in Rockport from 1929 to 1943, which he closed in 1943 due to poor health.  He spent some time, between 1931-3 and 1932, in Los Angeles painting.  A fire in 1947 destroyed his studio and a large part of his works produced over a 30-year period, delivering him a devastating blow.  Perhaps to ease the pain of this loss Thieme traveled for a short stay to Charleston, South Carolina, followed by trips to St. Augustine Florida, where he set up a studio.  During this time, he also visited the Caribbean islands and Central America.  From 1950 to his death in 1954, Thieme summered in Rockport and wintered in St. Augustine.  A prolific artist, Thieme was a member of the American Water Color Society; Art Alliance of America; Salmagundi Club; California Academy of Fine Arts; Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts; Boston Art Club; Providence Water Color Club; Boston Society of Artists; North Shore Art Association; Springfield Art League; Rockport Art Association; New York Water Color Club; American Artists Professional League; Gloucester Society of Artists; Art Alliance of Philadelphia; Philadelphia Painters Club; and the National Arts Club.
