   "body" : "Carl Marr was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin the son of John Marr, a wood-engraver.  Marr joined his father in the engraving business at age fifteen and studied with noted Milwaukee artist, Henry Vianden.  Marr traveled to Germany in 1875 and studied briefly at the Weimar Academy, followed by study at the Academy of Arts in Berlin with Karl Gussow, in Weimar with Martin Schaub, and the Royal Academy in Munich, with Otto Seitz and Wilhelm Lindenschmidt.  Marr returned to Milwaukee in 1880; however he returned to Munich two years later, where he remained until his death in 1936.  Unbeknownst to Marr, he had inadvertently given up his American citizenship with his acceptance of a professorship at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich in 1893.  He said later, that \"I had always considered myself an American and did not wish it to be any other way.\"  He traveled to the United States for family visits, painting commissions, and art exhibitions.  Marr developed an international following and In 1902 he was given The Royal Order of Merit of St. Michael Third Class, followed by other awards including the Prussian Order of the Crown III (1907); Royal Cross of a Knight, merit decoration of the Bavarian Crown (1909); Decoration of the Order of the Red Eagle (which gave him the privilege to add \"von\" to his name); Commendatore Cross of the Royal Order (Italy, 1912); and the Order of St. Michael's Second Class (1915).  During the short-lived Bavarian Council Republic (German Revolution of 1918-1919), Marr was forced to flee to Switzerland as the unstable new government had placed a bounty on him.  After the revolution, Marr returned to Germany, where, in 1919, he became the director of the Munich Academy.  That Marrâ€™s ties to America were never severed was in evidence when in 1924, he was made an honorary member of the American Association of Art and Literature, and in 1929 when the University of Wisconsin awarded him an honorary degree.  He exhibited at the Boston Art Club; National Academy of Design; The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; International Exhibition (Berlin, Germany 1879, Silver Medal, 1880, Great Silver Medal); International Exhibition (Munich, Germany 1885, Great Silver Medal); Prize Fund Exhibition (New York, NY, 1886, Gold Medal); International Exhibition (Munich, Germany, 1889, Gold Medal); International Exhibition (Berlin, Germany, 1890, 1891, 1896, Gold Medal); Exhibition of Scholars (Munich, Germany, 1892,Gold Medal for portraiture); World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1892-1893, gold medal); International Exhibition of Fine Arts (Madrid, Spain, 1893, First Prize); German Exhibition (Dresden, 1899, Gold Plaque); Salzburger Art Exhibition (Salzburg, Austria, 1901, Gold Medal); Exhibition of the Hungarian National Association of Artists (Budapest, 1903; International Exhibition (Munich, Germany, 1906, Gold Medal); 5th & 6th Exposition of International Art (Barcelona, Spain, 1907/1908, Medal First Class); International Exposition of Argentina, Buenos Aires (1910) and the Panama Pacific Exhibition (San Francisco, 1915).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
