  "body": "Burdick was born in East Killingly, Connecticut, but later moved to Providence, Rhode Island where he worked re-touching and coloring photographs. He formally studied art at the Union Hall School (Providence, RI), the Lowell Institute (Boston, MA) and the Museum School of Fine Arts (Boston, MA). During his time in Boston he began painting still-lifes; however, he later turned to painting landscapes and portraits, and it is for the latter that he is most famous. In 1927, Burdick’s painting of then U.S. President Calvin Coolidge was exhibited at the Boston Art Club by the membership in honor of his status as the oldest living member. Bedford Fine Art Gallery is proud to claim Burdick’s Coolidge painting among its other prominent artworks.",
