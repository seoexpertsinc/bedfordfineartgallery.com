   "body" : "George Cochran Lambdin, the son of James Reid Lambdin, famous portraitist, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  He learned about art and painting from his father and his fatherâs circle of artist friends.  In 1838 his family moved to Philadelphia, where he lived until his death.  He studied at the Pennsylvania of the Fine Arts.  As typical of many American artists of the time, he traveled to Europe to further develop his skills, and studied in Munich, Paris, and Rome.  During his lifetime, Lambdin was known for his skill in depicting sentimental genre subjects; however, it is his paintings of roses from his own garden for which he is best known.  He also painted portraits of many Philadelphia women, which usually included roses whose hues matched the complexion of the subject.  During the Civil War, Lambdin depicted the sentimental and psychological aspects of warfare rather than battles scenes as was typical.  Many of of his paintings of flowers, especially roses, were printed as chromolithographs.  Lambdin exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the 1867 Paris Universal Exposition.  He was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1868.\r\n",
