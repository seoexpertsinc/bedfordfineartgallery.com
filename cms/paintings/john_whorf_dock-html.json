   "body" : "Maritime artist, John Whorf was born in Winthrop, Massachusetts, the son of noted art, designer and pageant director, Harry C. Whorf. His first lessons were with his father, followed by study with Boston artist Sherman Kidd and with at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston) Philip Leslie Hale and William James, and St. Botolph Studio with Sherman Kidd. Whorf’s ancestors were from Provincetown, Massachusetts and Whorf spent summers at the family’s summer home there. In 1919 he studied with Provincetown artists George Elmer Browne and Charles Webster Hawthorne, founder of the Provincetown art colony in 1899. Whorf also studied in Paris, France at Ecole Colarossi, Académie Julian, Ecole des Beaux Arts, and Académie de la Grande Chaumiere. While there, he traveled throughout France, Spain, North Africa and the West Indies. Prior to his trip to France, Whorf had severed his sciatic nerve after jumping from a Provincetown wharf and shattering his hip after striking an unseen object, leaving him with permanent weakness. It was this injury that likely figured in his switch from painting in oil to watercolor, as it required equipment that was lighter and easier to transport. After his marriage in 1925, he lived in Brookline, a Boston suburb, while summering in Provincetown. In 1937 he moved permanently to his beloved Provincetown, where he was to remain for the rest of his life—it provided him with endless subject matter. He became known for his luminous watercolors of which one art critic noted \"there is very little Whorf cannot do with watercolor.\" His realistic manner of painting was complemented with a fluid, painterly style influenced by John Singer Sargent. Whorf was a member of National Academy of Design (NYC, 1947); American Watercolor Society; Florida Watercolor Society; The Beachcombers; and Provincetown Art Association. He exhibited at the Grace Horne Gallery, Boston (1924, first solo); American Watercolor Society; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1930); Oakland Art Gallery (1930, solo); Mills College (Oakland, 1931, solo); California Watercolor Society (1934); Art Institute of Chicago ( 1939, prize, 1943, prize); Whitney Museum of American Art; Kansas City Art Institute; Boston Museum of Fine Art; Boston Society Watercolor Painters; Brooklyn Museum; Philadelphia Watercolor Club; Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo; Milwaukee Art Institute; NOMA; New Rochelle Art Association; 19th Venice Biennale; M.H. DeYoung Museum; Worcester Art Museum; Cincinnati Art Museum; Milch Gallery (NYV, 32 solos).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $153,600.\r\n",
