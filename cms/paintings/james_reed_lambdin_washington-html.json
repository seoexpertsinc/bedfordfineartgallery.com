His subjects included politicians, soldiers in military uniform, and fifteen United States Presidents.\n\nIn 1837 he moved to Philadelphia where he served as president of the Artistâs Society Fund, director of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and also was a professor of fine arts at the University of Pennsylvania.   He was appointed by President Buchannan to serve as one of the United States arts commissioners.  Although best known as a portrait painter, he was also an accomplished landscape painter as well.  Most of his landscapes were small watercolors, notably of Lake George and the Catskills in New York.  Outside of paintings in the White House, this extraordinary work is one of the best by an important listed painter of presidential portraits.",
