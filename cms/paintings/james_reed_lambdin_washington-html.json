He was appointed by President Buchannan to serve as one of the United States arts commissioners.  Although best known as a portrait painter, he was also an accomplished landscape painter as well.  Most of his landscapes were small watercolors, notably of Lake George and the Catskills in New York.  Outside of paintings in the White House, this extraordinary work is one of the best by an important listed painter of presidential portraits.",
