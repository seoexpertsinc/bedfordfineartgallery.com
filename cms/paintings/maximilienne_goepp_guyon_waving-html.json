   "body" : "Maximilienne Guyon was an award-winning painter, illustrator, and etcher. She exhibited often, primarily in France, and won numerous awards, receiving the traveling purse in 1894, the first woman to whom it was given. She was held in high regard as a teacher, instructing the Princess Mathilde (of Saxony), who in her own right became a talented artist. Mme. Guyon was a successful portrait painter, having the ability to “unmask” the subject by artfully rendering individual characteristics of which they were previously unaware.  \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $9,770.",
