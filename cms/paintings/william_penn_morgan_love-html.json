   "body" : "William Penn Morgan, was not as one might think born in Pennsylvania, but London England. He arrived\r\n\r\nin Brooklyn, New York in 1851 after spending time studying in Paris at the atelier of Thomas Couture and\r\n\r\nat Le Havre. The interlude between his departure from Paris and his arrival in the United States was\r\n\r\nspent as a sailor. Once in New York, Morgan studied, by his own admission, somewhat lackadaisically at\r\n\r\nNational Academy of Design. As in Paris, he was prone to absorb himself with the sights and sounds of\r\n\r\nhis environment instead of rigorous academic studies. Regardless, his innate talent and artistic interest\r\n\r\nfinally manifested themselves and he began painting in earnest. Morgan became an accomplished\r\n\r\nportraitist, but it is for his genre depictions of women and young girls that he is best known. He began\r\n\r\nexhibiting at the National Academy of Design in 1852 and continued throughout his career. The\r\n\r\nAcademy memorialized his achievements in their records describing him \"as a painter of 'sterling merit'\r\n\r\nwhose treatment of subjects âreflected the sensitiveness and refinement of his own nature' \". Morgan\r\n\r\nalso exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fines Arts (Philadelphia, PA) between 1885 and 1888.\r\n\r\nHe was an elected member of the National Academy of Design and a member of the Artists Fund\r\n\r\nSociety.",
