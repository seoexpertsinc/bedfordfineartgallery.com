  "body": "Christiana Ross was a well-known watercolour landscape and figure painter. She was a member of the Royal Scottish Watercolorists. Ross was a prolific exhibitor, exhibiting at the Dowdeswell Gallery (four times), Glasgow Academy (31 times), Walker Art Gallery (32 times), Royal Scottish Academy (77 times), Royal Scottish Society of Watercolourists (66 times) in addition to Manchester Art Gallery, Royal Society of British Artists, Royal Hibernian Academy, and the Royal Institute of Watercolourists.\n\nThe painting shown above, “The Peddlers on the Road to Edinburgh” can be considered one of Christiana Ross’s finest paintings. The dominant green color is brightened by the blues and pinks of the subject’s clothing. The painting effectively conveys the feelings of the peddlers--that it is indeed a long, tiring road to Edinburgh",
