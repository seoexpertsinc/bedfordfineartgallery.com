  "body": "British artist, Howard Hill, immigrated to New York City in the 1860s where he was active into the 1870s. He is known for sporting art depicting hunters with their dogs or perhaps the dogs alone. He also painted grouse and quail, often with their chicks, and barnyard scenes featuring ducks and chickens. He was the maternal grandfather of noted American artist/illustrator, Norman Rockwell; however, Hill and his grandson never met—Hill died before Rockwell was born. Although now best known for his sporting scenes, Rockwell remembers his grandfather’s charming genre scenes depicting children at play. In fact, Rockwell kept an example of his grandfather’s work, a small painting of a quail, in his studio. This painting, “Quail Decoying a Hunting Dog”, is one of Hill’s sporting art scenes showcasing the hunting dog in action. Hill exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York City in 1865 and 1866.",
