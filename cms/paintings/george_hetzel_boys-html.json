   "body" : "George Hetzel was born in the French province of Alsace, but immigrated with his family to America in 1828,\r\nsettling in Allegheny City (Pittsburgh's North Side). In his teens Hetzel began an apprenticeship with a painter\r\nwith whom he helped decorate river boat cabins and murals for Pittsburgh saloons. Recognizing his artistic\r\ntalent, George's father sent him to the Dusseldorf Art Academy for formal training. After returning to\r\nPittsburgh, Hetzel quickly established himself as one of Pittsburgh's leading artists, obtaining commissions for\r\nportraits, still-lifes and landscapes. His early paintings reflect his Dusseldorf training--the use of chiaroscuro\r\nand the realism for which the Academy was known. Hudson River school landscape artists, Asher B. Durand\r\nand Jasper Cropsey, were among Hetzel's friends, and he owned some of their paintings. A fishing trip for\r\nmountain trout 1866 exposed him to the beauty of the Paint Creek and Little Paint Creek areas, near Scalp\r\nLevel, Pennsylvania. The following summer he returned, bringing with him the faculty of the Pittsburgh School\r\nof Design to paint landscapes from nature. Every summer through the late 1860s to circa 1890, artists from\r\nPittsburgh traveled to Scalp Level to study nature and to sketch and paint. Hetzel exhibited at the National\r\nAcademy of Design (New York City, 1857-58, 1865, 1875, 1879-1882); the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine\r\nArts, the Centennial International Exhibition (Philadelphia, 1876) and the World's Columbian Exhibition\r\n(Chicago, 1983). Hetzel was the only Pittsburgh artist invited to exhibit at the 1876 Centennial International\r\nExhibition in Philadelphia.",
