   "body" : "American Impressionist artist Guy Wiggins was born in Brooklyn, New York, son of Barbizon artist Carleton Wiggins. His artistic talent expressed itself early when at the age of eight some of his watercolors, painted during European travels with his family in in the 1890s, were praised by New York art critics. His first study was with his father, followed by architectural study at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. His formal art training began at the National Academy of Design circa 1902 with William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri. A resident of New York City, Wiggins spent his summers in Old Lyme, Connecticut beginning in 1904. Prior to the onset of World War I, Wiggins spent time in England painting the quaint and picturesque English countryside. It was in England that he met his wife, Dorothy Stuart Johnson. After the couple returned to the United States, they bought a home on Potash Hill, Lyme, Connecticut, circa 1918. Wiggins is best known for his snow scenes of New York City and the area around Old Lyme, Connecticut. During the early part of the 20th century, Wiggins continued to hone his unique style of painting, and hit his stride in the 1920s and 30s. Art critics of that time commented that his “New England landscapes were painted with the most eminent sophistication. When he uses a tree as a painting theme, he puts the individuality of the tree into the picture and it really seems as if the tree lived and contributed to the sum of the world’s happiness.” Probably best known for his snow scenes of New York City and the area around Old Lyme, Connecticut, critic W.G. Bowdoin (Feb. 22, 1921, New Evening World) referred to “Wiggins trees” and his “winter tree music.” A fire at his Old Lyme studio in 1923 destroyed many of his prize-winning canvasses—he was only able to save 10 of his paintings Circa 1927 he opened the Guy Wiggins Art School near Hamburg Cove north of Old Lyme. In 1930 Wiggins opened a studio in New Haven, Connecticut where he would “conduct and Criticize” classes in painting. Wiggins remained in Old Lyme until 1937 when he moved to Essex, Connecticut, moving his school with him. He died in St. Augustine, Florida in 1962 while on vacation. Wiggins was a member of the : National Academy of Design (assoc. 1916; academician 1936); Salmagundi club (1907); Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts (pres., 1927-1930s); Lotos Club; Lyme Art Association; Kit Kat Club; New Haven PCC; National Arts Club (NYC). He exhibited at the : Corcoran Gallery biennials (1908-1923); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1912-1934); Salmagundi Club (1916, prize, 1919, prize); Art Institute of Chicago (1917, Norman Wait Harris Bronze Medal); CAFA (prizes in 1916, 1918, 1926, 1931, 1933); RIDS (1922, prize); New Rochelle Society (1929, prize); New Haven PCC (1930, prize) and the Lotos Club (1938, prize). \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $374,400.
