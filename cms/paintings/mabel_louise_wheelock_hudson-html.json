She attended the former Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago and later studied at the Art Institute of Chicago.  She traveled extensively throughout the United States and Mexico, to tour and to find subjects for her paintings.  Wheelock painted at the Summer school of the Art Institute of Chicago at Ox-Bow in Saugatuck, Michigan in the 1920s.  Today she is best known for her small California landscapes of scenes around San Diego and La Jolla.  “On the Esopus Creek” would have been painted during a trip to the Catskill Mountains in New York State.  Esopus Creek is a tributary to the Hudson River.  In 1930 Wheelock was named to the Board of Directors of the North Shore Art League (Winetka, IL).  She exhibited at the art department of the Women’s Club of Wilmette and the Art Institute of Chicago. ",
