   "body" : "Hamilton was born in Oxford, England, but came to Cowlesville (near Buffalo), New York with his family while young.  Although his parents did not fully support his choice of art as a profession, they financed his trip to Paris, France in 1870.  When he returned home in 1872, he opened a portrait studio; however, the following year, he was in Colorado on a sketching trip.  His Colorado landscapes and were chosen for inclusion at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  For more than 20 years, Hamilton returned to Denver to paint. A second trip to France in 1878 found him painting en plein air with the Barbizon artists at the Pont Aven artists' colony in Brittany.  In 1881, Hamilton moved to New York City and opened a studio.  While there, he became acquainted with other well-known artists of that time-- Robert Blum, William Merritt Chase, Birge Harrison, Winslow Homer, and Thomas Moran.  Following his return to the United States after an 1895 trip to the Cornish coast of England, he began painting scenes of Long Island and Peekskill, New York.  Southern California also beckoned the artist; he spent a year there in 1907â08, and in 1910 he moved to Pasadena until circa 1912, followed by a permanent move to Norwalk, Connecticut.  He painted at the nearby artists' colony at the nearby town of Silvermine,founded by artist Solon Borglum.  After Borglum's death in 1922, Hamilton and other artists founded the Silvermine Guild of Artists, of which Hamilton became the informal \"dean.\"  He was a member of the National Academy of Design; Silvermine Guild of Artists; American Watercolor Society; and the Century Association.
