   "body" : "Simon was born in Schlietz in Saxony and 1848 was bought to Philadelphia by his family who were escaping the impacts of the revolution, which had engulfed Europe at the time.  He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with Robert Wylie (1839-1877), and later with George F. Bensell (1837-1879) and Henry W. Bispham (1842-1882).  Simon was well-known in the Philadelphia area as a âdog portraitistâ, although he painted landscapes that often incorporated other animals.  A versatile artist, Simon was also commissioned for portraiture work of local Philadelphia notables.  He was contemporary of controversial Philadelphia artist, Thomas Eakins, but, Simonâs primary choice of subjects, animals, not nudes, kept Simon from running afoul of Philadelphia society.  Simon was a member of the Philadelphia Sketch Club and the Artists Fund Society.  He exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1863 and between 1876 and 1887, Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, and with the Philadelphia Society of Artists 1879-1881 and again in 1884.  He also exhibited at the Boston Art Club, National Academy of Design and the Art Institute of Chicago.  Simon exhibited the âGlimpse of the Delaware at Dingmanâs Ferryâ at the 1882 Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n",
