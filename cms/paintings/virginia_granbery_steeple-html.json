   "body" : "Granbery was born in Norfolk, Virginia, but she and her older sister, Henrietta were brought to New York\r\nCity as children. She studied at the Cooper Institute (now The Cooper Union for the Advancement of\r\nScience and Art) and the National Academy of Design. While at âThe Cooperâ, Ganbery studied with\r\nlandscapist, Albert Fitch Bellows. In addition to be being a gifted artist, she was also an exceptional\r\nteacher, who taught art at the Packer Collegiate Institute, in Brooklyn, New York from 1871 to 1882.\r\nAnnie Cooper Boyd, the noted Sag Harbor artist, took painting lessons from Virginia and her sister\r\nHenrietta also an artist. Boyd a marine and plein-air landscape painter of the Sag Harbor and the\r\nHamptons area on Long Island, New York invited both Granbery sisters to visit her there to give her\r\nlessons in 1887. Perhaps best known for her still-lifes of fruit, Virginia Granbery also painted landscapes,\r\nincluding the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Later in life, Granbery concentrated more on\r\nportraiture and genre. Granbery exhibited at the National Academy of Design (1859 - 1890); the\r\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1860 to 1889); and the Brooklyn Art Association (1861 to 1886).\r\nVirginia and her sister were among a handful of women whose artwork was accepted for exhibition at\r\nthe Centennial Exposition of 1876, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
