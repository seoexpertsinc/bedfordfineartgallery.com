   "body" : "C. Myron Clark was a Massachusetts mountain landscapist, who is known for his paintings of sailing ships, the best-known of which is of the USS Constitution.  In 1906, he was commissioned by the State of Massachusetts to paint the frigate The U.S.S. Constitution, a painting that hung in the Massachusetts State House until the 1940s. Clark worked in both oil and watercolor, painting mostly Massachusetts scenes; however, he made forays into Canada as recorded through his oil landscape of Mounts Skihist and Lilovet, which was painted north of Vancouver, British Columbia.  Many of his works are in the collection of the Peabody Museum in Salem, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
