   "body" : "Impressionist painter Edward Volkert was born was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Volkert studied at the Art Academy of Cincinnati under Frank Duveneck and later at the Art Students League in New York City with George de Forest Brush, Henry Siddons Mowbray and plein air artist William Merritt Chase.  For a time Volker lived in New York, but in 1922 he moved to Hamburg, Connecticut near Old Lyme, which had become a thriving art colony.  He would visit “Miss Florence” Griswold’s boarding house in Old Lyme where the Impressionist artists congregated to socialize and discuss their art.  It was among this group of artists that he fostered the notion that American artists had to find their own styles and not merely copy those of the European artists.  Prior to his moving to Hamburg, Volkert had developed a fascination with painting accurate depictions of cattle and oxen, preferring the latter as the subjects of his paintings.  Volkert said \"Oxen are twice as good as cows at posing, because they are always ready to stand still and are not as inquisitive as cows who come over to investigate.\"  He was to become known as \"America's cattle painter.\"  Volkert created what he called his \"Cattle Logs\", which were books of to scale reproductions of most of his completed paintings, so that he could recreate any painting should it be lost or destroyed.  He lost his desire to paint after the death of his daughter in 1933 and he succumbed to uremic poisoning two years later.  Volkert was a member of the Duveneck Society of Cincinnati (OH); president of the Bronx Art Guild and a member of the American Federation of Arts; American Watercolor Society, Painters in Watercolor; Lyme Art Association (CT); National Academy of Design (NYC); National Arts Club, (NYC); New Haven Paint & Clay Club; New York Water Color Club, Society; Salmagundi Club (NYC).  Volkert exhibited at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia, PA); Panama Pacific International Exhibition (San Francisco, CA, 1915); American Watercolor Society, Painters in Watercolor; Lyme Art Association-Connecticut; National Academy of Design; Paint and Clay Club; Salmagundi Club; Art Institute of Chicago; and Corcoran Gallery, Washington D.C.\n\n High auction record for this artist is $21,150.
