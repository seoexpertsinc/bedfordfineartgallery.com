   "body" : "Darley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Although a self-taught artist, he went on to become an illustrator for American luminaries as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, and Edgar Allen Poe.  His illustrations were also included in the works of other American writers--Clement Clarke Moore, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mary Maples Dodge, George Lippard, Donald Grant Mitchell, and Frances Parkman.  Recognized as one of American first and finest illustrators, he and his peers ousted European artists from their lofty perches as the premier mid-19th century illustrators.  \"Illustrated by Darley\", was a major selling point for books of the day.  Darley lived in Philadelphia until around 1849 when he moved to New York City and became a house artist for Harper's Weekly: A Journal of Civilization.  In 1859, after his marriage, Darley and his wife moved to Claymont, Delaware.  His home, named the Wren's Nest, by Darley, is now known as the Darley House, and is on the National Register of Historic Places.  Darley died at his home in 1888, reportedly \"with pencil in hand\".  Although he died in Clayton, he is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Darley exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Brooklyn Art Association, National Academy of Design, where he was an elected member, and the Society of Illustrators.  Bedford Fine Art Gallery is proud to offer the original ink drawing of Washington, Henry and Pendleton Going to the First Congress from which an engraving was made by Bryan Hall and subsequently included in Washington Irving's Life of George Washington (1859, G.P. Putnam, NY). A wonderful addition to your Americana collection. \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $36,300.",
