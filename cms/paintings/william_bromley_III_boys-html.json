   "body" : "William Bromley was the son of an artist and grandson of an engraver.  He began his artistic career as an engraver, but forayed into genre painting.  He is best known for his portrayals of young children at play, often with pets, but often engrossed in the game of marbles, a popular pastime of Victorian children.  He was influenced by the Scottish painter, Sir David Wilkie and Irish painter, William Mulready, both of whom were influenced by the Flemish School where emphasis was placed on telling a story based on scenes of everyday life.  He was skilled at positioning his subjects in such a manner that concentrated their activity so that the meaning of his "story" was instantly conveyed.  Bromley exhibited many of his paintings at Suffolk Street, The Royal Academy, and the British Institution.",
