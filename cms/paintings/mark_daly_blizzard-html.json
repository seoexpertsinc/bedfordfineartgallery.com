He also writes music for and plays the mandolin.  Of himself as an artist Daly states “I paint life’s joys. I feel truly blessed to be able to create and share happiness through oil paint. My visual stories are revealed through impressions of city, boat, beach, and other memorable scenes.\"  He has exhibited at Cincinnati Art Galleries (2014, solo); American Impressionist Society's 14th National Exhibition (2013, Charleston, South Carolina, Dickinson Signature Award); Cincinnati Art Club ViewPoint 45 (2013, gold medal); Cincinnati Art Club ViewPoint 44 (2012, Viewpoint Excellence Award); Cincinnati Art Galleries (2012, \"The Musician's Paintbrush\", solo); The American Impressionist Society's 12th Annual National Juried Exhibition (2011, Carmel, California); Cincinnati Art Galleries (2010, \"Conversations with Nature\", solo); and Oil Painters of America Eastern Regional Show (Jacksonville, Florida).
