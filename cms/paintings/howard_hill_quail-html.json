   "body" : "British artist, Howard Hill, immigrated to New York City in the 1860s where he was active into the 1870s.\r\nHe is known for sporting art depicting hunters with their dogs or perhaps the dogs alone. He also\r\npainted grouse and quail, often with their chicks, and barnyard scenes featuring ducks and chickens. He\r\nwas the maternal grandfather of noted American artist/illustrator, Norman Rockwell; however, Hill and\r\nhis grandson never metâHill died before Rockwell was born. Although now best known for his sporting\r\nscenes, Rockwell remembers his grandfather's charming genre scenes depicting children at play. In fact,\r\nRockwell kept an example of his grandfather's work, a small painting of a quail, in his studio. This\r\npainting, âQuail Decoying a Hunting Dogâ, is one of Hill's sporting art scenes showcasing the hunting dog\r\nin action. Hill exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York City in 1865 and 1866.\r\n",
