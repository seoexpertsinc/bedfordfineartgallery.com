   "body" : "Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Morse can be considered an American sporting artist, known for his exquisite renderings of dogs and wildlife.  He learned engraving from his father; however, he turned to jewelry making and later to diamond cutting.  He is the first known American to have practiced this art and he further introduced revolutionary new cutting practices.  A natural artist, his earlier training for which a good eye is required, prepared him for his later career as a painter.  His finely executed paintings have been exhibited at the Boston Art Club and the National Academy of Design.  He is listed in âDavenport's Art Reference" (Davenport, 2005), âThe Artists Bluebook" (Dunbier, 2005), âMantle Field's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors and Engravers" (Opitz, 1986), and the âNew York Historical Society's Dictionary of Artists in America" (Grace and Wallace, 1957).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
