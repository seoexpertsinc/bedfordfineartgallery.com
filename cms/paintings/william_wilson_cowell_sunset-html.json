   "body" : "William Wilson Cowell was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of William Cowell and well-known,\r\npopular Chicago actress, Anna Cruise Cowell. Cowell studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine\r\nArts with marine painters, Edward Moran and John Faulkner. He painted in New York State, notably the\r\nAdirondack Mountains and the Hudson River, Newport and the Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, the\r\nrocky coasts of Hahant and Marblehead, Massachusetts and the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia. Circa 1895,\r\nCowell moved to Chicago, Illinois, but spent his summers in Nova Scotia. He adopted a primarily\r\nluminist manner in his landscapes and marine scenes; however, although many of paintings are of ships\r\nat sunset or at night, they maintain the characteristic low horizon of the luminists, with the diffused light\r\nof the setting sun or rising moon. Cowell was a member of the Brooklyn Art Association and the\r\nNational Academy of Design, where he also exhibited. He also exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of\r\nthe Fines Arts from 1876 to 1900 and the Art Institute of Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
