   "body" : "Erik is a traditional landscape painter who has become a leader in the revival of the techniques and philosophy of the Hudson River School. Koeppel studied extensively in museums, and in nature to arrive at the determination that the powerful methods of the masters, are in fact an urgently needed voice in contemporary culture. In mastering these techniques, this assertion has been proven by the extensive success his work has found nationwide, in the form of awards, publications, academic recognition, exhibitions, and collectability. His highly naturalistic paintings are created without the use of photography. Erik says that in the act of painting he has sought to discover that highest knowledge of Beauty, poetic and philosophical, that has been the common thread between all of the great masters of Art. He has spent hours staring at the finest masterpieces in museums worldwide in an effort to decipher that meditative effect that distinguishes greatness from proficiency, and have made the creation of that sentiment his central goal as an artist. Following this path has led him to study deeply the sciences of philosophy, design, linear perspective, anatomy, color, optics, architecture, botany, light and atmosphere with respect to their purposes in art, and he has built a foundation of consistent formal principles that work in harmony to illuminate meaning in painting. As his subject, he has chosen the universal human condition in this world, and has sought, wherever possible, to discard the sociopolitical fashions of contemporary culture in favor of those enduring sentiments that we all encounter in life. It is his belief that to experience the Beauty of our existence here in this magnificent landscape is the only way to happiness. His intention as an artist is to share that Beauty.\r\n\r\n",
