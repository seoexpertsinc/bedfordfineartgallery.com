   "body" : "We believe this painting of Teddy Roosevelt was painted by American Impressionist painter William Samuel Horton.  We estimate this painting was completed circa 1909 in Red Wing Minnesota.  At this time, Roosevelt was in Red Wing to sign the Presidential Proclamation #848 establishing the Superior National Forest.  Horton was born in Michigan and lived in New York and France.  He was a member of the New York Watercolor Club, Salmagund Club, American Federation of Arts, Society International, Salon d’Automone and other art clubs.  Horton was a wealthy man and was reportedly friends with such famous Impressionists as Monet, Degas, Derain and others.\n\nAfter his early Paris exhibitions he rarely allowed his works to be sold.  At his death in 1936, his estate contained more than 1,000 oils, pastels, and watercolors.  His works are part of the Brooklyn Museum and the Collection National Museum of American Art in\r\nWashington DC.  The art critic Henri Fritsch Estrangin stated “Horton’s work is a feast of color and light.”\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $104,500.",
