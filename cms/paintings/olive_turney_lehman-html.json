  "body": "Olive Turney was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania and raised in the Lawrenceville section of\\\nPittsburgh. Her father was a carpenter and served on the Lawrenceville Borough Council. Her sister,\\\nMargaret, was killed in the deadly Allegheny Arsenal Explosion during the Civil War. In 1865 she\\\nenrolled in the first class of the Pittsburgh School of Design for women, where her talent and\\\nexuberance led to her teaching Saturday classes at the school. Turney also became the favorite of\\\nGeorge Hetzel, the noted Pittsburgh landscape artist and founder of the Scalp Level School. In 1867\\\nHetzel organized the first of what was to become a yearly summer pilgrimage from the industrial\\\nlandscape of Pittsburgh to the “wilds” of rural Scalp Level, near Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Turney, with\\\nsix students from the Pittsburgh School of Design, was invited to accompany Hetzel and other notable\\\nPittsburgh artists to sketch and paint the rocky creeks and rustic landscape. The women were led by\\\ninstructor Miss Mayhurst and chaperoned by the mother of Pittsburgh Industrialist Andrew Carnegie\\\nand George Hetzel’s wife, Louisa. Turney graduated with honors in 1872 and became a teacher at the\\\nschool and later its principal until it closed in 1904. During her summers at Scalp Level she made the\\\nacquaintance of the Lehman family who had a farm at there and with whom she developed a lifelong\\\nfriendship. Adam Lehman built her a cottage on a half-acre of his property that Turney had purchased\\\nfrom him in 1888. She spent nearly 40 summers painting in the small cottage she affectionately called\n\nthe “Sketch Box. Many of her paintings depict Lehman family members and the Lehman farm. In the\\\n1870s a Pittsburgh art critic wrote that Turney’s work was “felicitous in depicting the warm glow of the\\\nsunset or the ethereal freshness of a morning sky.” In 1888 her style was described in The Social Mirror\\\nas “vigorous, full of color and dash”. She also traveled to the Cumberland Valley of Maryland and Lake\\\nChautauqua in New York State, and continued to paint into her 80s. Turney was a member of the\\\nAmerican Artists Professional League and exhibited at the Pittsburgh School of Design (1872, gold\\\nmedal); and the first Carnegie International (1896). This painting is from descendants of Mary Louise\\\nWear, whose portrait Turney painted in 1924 when Wear was four years old, and was exhibited at the",
