   "body" : "Wust was born in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, the son of Dutch portraitist Chistoffel Wust.  By the late 1850s, he had made his way to New York City where he opened his artist’s studio.  Wust is best known for his landscapes of the Adirondacks, Catskill Mountains, and the Mohawk Valley in New York State, the Green Mountains and New England executed in a detailed, romantic style comparable to that of the Hudson River School.  Wust painted scenes of Lake Winnepesaukee, Mount Washington in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and Mount Desert Island, Maine.  Like the Hudson River School artists, Wust captured on canvas the wild, unspoiled areas of Adirondack and Catskill Mountains in New York State and the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  His landscapes present the viewer with an accurate portrayal of majestic topography sculpted by nature over vast geologic time.  Many of his works are bathed in a luministic aura that adds an emotional depth.  In the early 1870’s, Wust, visited Norway where he painted it’s rugged, mountainous terrain.  He moved to Europe in 1874 and died in 1876 at Antwerp, Belgium.  Wust exhibited at the National Academy of Design, Brooklyn Art Association and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Boston Atheneum.  He was awarded a gold medal at the universal art exhibition in Brussels and The Hague (1866) and awarded a medal at the Vienna World’s Fair (1873).\r\n",
