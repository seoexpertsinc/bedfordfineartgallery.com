Alke married fellow artist Elizabeth Heil in 1912. Interestingly, he and Elizabeth had first met in 1900 when they were both living in the same Cincinnati boarding house in 1900 and then again in 1905 on Fullerton Avenue where they both maintained studios. A versatile artist he designed art glass and poster, in addition to being an accomplished portrait and landscape painter. He moved to Cincinnati after his wifeâs death in 1938, where he died in 1941.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
