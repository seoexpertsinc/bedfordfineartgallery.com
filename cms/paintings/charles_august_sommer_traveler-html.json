   "body" : "Very little biographical information is currently available for Carl Sommer. He was born in Germany, but when he came to the United States is unknown, nor do we know if he returned to Germany at some point. That he was a landscape artist in the style of the Hudson River School seems apparent from an examination of his work. It is known that he painted scenes in the Catskill and Adirondack Mountains; Hudson and Delaware River valleys; and the rocky coasts at Newport, RI. Sommer exhibited at the National Academy of Design (NYC) and the Pennsylvania /academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia, PA). \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $9,000.",
