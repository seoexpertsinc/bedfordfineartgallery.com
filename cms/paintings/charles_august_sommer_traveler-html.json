He was born in Germany, but\r\nwhen he came to the United States is unknown, nor do we know if he returned to Germany at some\r\npoint. That he was a landscape artist in the style of the Hudson River School seems apparent from an\r\nexamination of his work. It is known that he painted scenes in the Catskill and Adirondack Mountains;\r\nHudson and Delaware River valleys; and the rocky coasts at Newport, RI. Sommer exhibited at the\r\nNational Academy of Design (NYC) and the Pennsylvania /academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia, PA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $9,000.",
