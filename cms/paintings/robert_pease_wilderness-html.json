   "body" : "Pease was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1925 and from his childhood he loved being outdoors and observing nature.  His knowledge of the animals he paints, his eye for detail and color, and his consummate skill result in wonderful photo-realistic compositions.  As a youth, Pease sketched animals, not only in their natural habitat but visited zoos to capture a broader range of animals.  He graduated from the Swain School of Design in New Bedford, MA and worked as a successful independent commercial illustrator and painter.  His paintings and illustrations appeared in the Saturday Evening Post and a number of sporting magazinesâ€”Field & Stream, Outdoor Life, Sports Afield, Trapper and Big Game.  Pease was a member of the Society of Animal Artists, an organization founded in the 1950s that was \"devoted to promoting excellence in the portrayal of the creatures sharing our planet.\"",
