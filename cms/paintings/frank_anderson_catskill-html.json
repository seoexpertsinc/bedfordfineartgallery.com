He is believed to have made improvements to the telegraph.  Also lacking is knowledge of his art training; however, the 1860s through the 1880s found him living in Peekskill, New York.  His style is considered Hudson River School, although not as well-known as other Hudson River artists.  Although shy when involved in public events, Anderson exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Pennsylvania) and the National Academy of Design (New York).  Many of his works are privately held and are seldom seen in public displays.   Bedford Fine Art Gallery is thrilled to have discovered this fine gem.",
