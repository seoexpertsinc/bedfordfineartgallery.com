His formal art training began\r\nwith Thomas Eakins and Thomas Anshutz in 1880 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in\r\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. Circa 1883, Waugh left for Paris, France to study at the Académie Julian with\r\nAdolphe William Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury. He returned to Philadelphia in 1885 after his\r\nfather died and his career at this point consisted of portraiture and commercial work for Dakin and\r\n\r\nPetrie. In 1892 he returned to Paris and circa 1893 traveled to England. Waugh had become enchanted\r\nby the sea during voyages across the ocean and it was during his stay in England that be began painting\r\nseascapes in earnest, and by which he made his living while abroad. He painted en plein air on the\r\nIsland of Sark (Channel Islands) in the English Channel and in 1895 set up a studio in the fishing village of\r\nCornwall, on the southwest peninsula of England. Waugh and his family moved to Hendon, near London\r\nin 1899, where he supplemented his income by doing commercial illustration work, including that of the\r\nsecond Boer War (1899 – 1902) for London Daily Mail publisher, Lord Northcliffe. In 1907 after being\r\naway for 15 years, he returned to the United States, and in 1908 was residing in Montclair Heights, New\r\nJersey. Art collector and businessman William T. Evans became his benefactor and offered him the\r\nformer studio space of George Inness in exchange for Waugh providing him with one painting a year. He\r\nlater lived on Baily Island, Maine and Monhegan Island, Maine. Waugh spent his last years in\r\nProvincetown, Massachusetts, where continued to paint and designed renovations for Saint Mary’s\r\nEpiscopal Church in the 1930s. A. Seaton Schmidt, a writer for the The International Studio (February\r\n1914) said that \"Waugh reveled in the buffeting winds and storm-tossed seas, wiping the salty spray\r\nfrom his eyes and painting on until the light was completely gone.\" In 1918, during the First World War,\r\nWaugh joined the Design section of the U.S. Navy under the direction of artist Everett L. Warner as a\r\ncamouflage artist.
