   "body" : "This stunning portrait of George Washington may have been printed as part of the 1876 Centennial. The print has minor paper loss on top left and bottom corners, but still retains its beautiful colors. This portrait print of Washington is flanked by patriotic symbols, including Washingtonâ€™s tomb at Mount Vernon. Overall this is a wonderful example of one of the best chromolithographs of the Father of our Republic.",
