   "body" : "Decker was born in Troy, New York; however, his family then moved to Brooklyn, New York circa 1860\r\nand in 1870, they moved to Maquoketa, Iowa where Decker established himself as a landscape painter.\r\nIn 1875 Decker returned to Troy and later maintained a studio at a number of successive locations in\r\nBrooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill and Clinton Hill. He studied under noted tonalist landscape and marine\r\npainter R. Swain Gifford in New York City. He and his wife bought a home/studio, called Woodbine, in\r\nHague-on-Lake-George in the Adirondack Mountains, New York. The Deckers would summer at Lake\r\nGeorge, where he painted small works for the annual influx of tourists, and spent winters in New York\r\nCity. He was a very successful artist during his lifetime--his most sought after works were his serene\r\ninterior forest scenes of the Adirondack Mountains and the Lake George area, often depicting fall and\r\nwinter and he would often prolong his stay at Woodbine to paint the crisp, wintery scenes. The New\r\nYork Herald once described his paintings as \"notable examples of art subordinated to nature, as all true\r\nart should be...\" He had among his patrons, which included professors, judges, public officials, business\r\ntycoons, and art collectors, Mrs. F.O. French, the mother of Mrs. Alfred Vanderbilt and the Peabody\r\nfamily. Decker was considered a prolific painter, but you would not know it—many of his works were\r\ndestroyed by an unfortunate selection of storage space, while others were simply lost or forgotten.\r\nDecker was a member of the Brooklyn Art Club, Brooklyn Society of Artists, Brooklyn Institute, New York\r\nArt Guild and Brooklyn Academy of Photography. In addition to his Brooklyn studios, he exhibited at the\r\nPittsburgh Athletic Association and J. J. Gillespie’s, both in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; National Academy\r\nof Design, Macbeth Gallery, the Sherk Galleries, the Lafayette Square Galleries’, Meyers Fine Art Gallery\r\nin New York City; State University College at Plattsburgh, N.Y; Hyde Collection, Glens Falls, N.Y.;\r\nMontauk Club, Brooklyn; Williams and Everett, Boston; Helman-Taylor Galleries, Cleveland, OH; Hillside\r\nHouse, Adirondacks; Williams & Everett, Boston; the Hillside House, Adirondacks; and the Pennsylvania\r\nAcademy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $15,275.",
