   "body" : "Born in Amesbury, Massachusetts, Davis lived across the street from poet John Greenleaf Whittier.  At fifteen Davis began working at a carriage factory, an industry for which, Amesbury was known and studying art in Boston when he could.  He first saw the works of the French Barbizon artists in 1874, and experienced a âconversion,â a âlight flash suddenly into a hitherto darkened soul,â as he gazed upon the works of Jean Francois Millet.  In 1877 he enrolled in the newly opened School of Drawing and Painting at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.  Whittier recognized Davisâs passion and talent and convinced Jacob Huntington, the owner of the factory, where Davis worked, and an artist himself, to finance Davisâs study at the AcadÃ©mie Julian in Paris.  In 1880 he traveled to Paris to enroll in the AcadÃ©mie Julian and, for two years, studied under William Adolphe Bouguereau, Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger.  In 1882, he moved to the village of Fleury, near the art colony at Barbizon, where he captured the French countryside of Fontainebleau and Normandy, painting in the tonal manner of the Barbizon School plein air artists.  In 1891, he returned to the United States and settled in Mystic, Connecticut, and in 1892 started the Mystic Art Colony, and later the Mystic Art Association in 1913.  In the mid-1890s Davis lightened his from the darker Barbizon palette to the lighter palette of the Impressionists, but maintaining his own artistic style.  In the 20th century he became noted for, as American art critic William Gerdts stated, âcloudscapes with brilliant blues, and cumulous clouds \"and vivid color contrasts that endowed the scene with the characteristic Impressionist sense of the momentary.\"  Davis was a member of the Society of American Artists (1886); Associate Member National Academy of Design (1901); Academician National Academy of Design (1906); Copley Society; Lotos Club; National Arts Club; Mystic Art Association (founder, 1913); American Federation of Arts; and the Grand Central Art Gallery (NYC).
