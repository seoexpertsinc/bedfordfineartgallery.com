   "body" : "Born in Paris, Trayer studied painting under his father and Lequien.  He is known both for his\r\n\r\nlandscape and his genre works.  Trayer garnered success during his time and exhibited at the\r\n\r\nParis Salons.  In 1855 he exhibited at the renowned Exposition Universelle along with noted\r\n\r\nFrench artistsâIngress, Delacroix, and Lehman, and noted British artists William Holman Hunt\r\n\r\nand John Everett Millais.  The quality of the art works on display were said to have surpassed all\r\n\r\nprevious French exhibitions.  His often poignant genres executed with a muted palette leave no\r\n\r\ndoubt that he was one of Franceâs premier artists.",
