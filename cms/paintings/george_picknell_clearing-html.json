He was the younger brother of noted plein air landscapist William Lamb Picknell and as a young man he was apprenticed to a Boston engraver.  In 1887 he traveled to Paris, France to study at the Academie Julian under Jules Lefebvre and Benjamin Constant.  In 1890 Picknell returned to Boston and worked as an illustrator in Boston and New York for several years.  Circa 1895 Picknell left for Paris a second time.  This time he stayed for 15 years, returning to the United States circa 1910.  He first lived in Freehold, NJ followed by a move, in 1912, to the art colony at Silvermine, CT, where he lived until his death in 1943.  Picknell is best known for his landscapes and seascapes of Connecticut and Massachusetts.  During his time in France, in addition to “typical” landscapes, he painted the salt marshes at Etaples.
