There he was educated in the local public school and the Suffield Academy, and then the long-gone Eastmanâs Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York.  He served in the U. S. Navy during the Civil War and survived his stay at the infamous Confederate Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia after his ship, the U.S.S. Isaac Smith, was captured.
