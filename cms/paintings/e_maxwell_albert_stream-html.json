   "body" : "Impressionist artist, Ernest Albert was the son of noted theater scene painter Ernest Albert.  Born in Chicago, Illinois. Albert, Sr. later moved the family to New Rochelle, NY.  Albert began his studies with his father and later at the Art Student League in New York City in 1905 with Impressionist landscape painter, Frank Vincent Dumond.  In the summer of 1908, Albert and his father visited Old Lyme Art Colony in Connecticut, whose director was Albertâs former teacher at the Art Students League, Frank Dumond.  While there, they stayed with Miss. Florence Griswold, the gracious and well-known hostess, whose house was not only the center of the Old Lyme Art Colony, but also provided room, board and entertainment for a number of artists who arrived there every summer.  During World War I, Albert served with the U.S. Army and survived the Spanish Flu of 1918.  Later that year he was honorably discharged in order to return home to help his mother who was convalescing from the flu.  During the 1920s Albert was living in New Canaan, CT, and it was at this time that he began signing his paintings as \"E. Maxwell Albert\" with greater frequency.  As an illustrator, he provided drawings for the American Red Cross, Country Life magazine and for the Wing-Thayer Advertising Company and the Charles Daniel Frey Advertising Company.  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Works Progress Administration (WPA), under which a subdivision, the Federal Art Project (FAP), was established to provide economic relief to artists.  Albert participated in this program and gained acclaim as an art restorer.  His enhanced profile led to a number of his works being installed in the state office building in Hartford, CT.  The art world had been changing rapidly since World War 1.  The 1920s and 1930s saw the advent of Art Deco, Cubism Surrealism, and a host of other movements and styles that continued through World War II into the present post-modern era.  He never became an adherent of these new styles, preferring the Impressionist style that was his forte.  Albert was a member of National Academy of Design (NYC); Allied Artists of America (Honorary Vice-President); American Water Color Society; Grand Central Galleries; Lime Art Association (1909); Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts; New Haven Paint and Clay Club; Silver Mine Guild of Artists; New Rochelle Art Association (1921, Adolph Grant Prize); Salmagundi Club; National Art Club (1921).  He exhibited at the New Rochelle Library (1916); New Canaan Society of Artists (1917); Salmagundi Club (1918; 1923, E. Irving prize); Silver Mine Art Gallery (1919); Casson Galleries (Boston, 1924); and Holt Gallery (NYC, 1925-26). This painting, \"Winter Landscape with Stream\" was exhibited at the Lyme Art Association Centennial Exhibition, \"The Early Years\" in 2002.\r\n\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $20,700.",
