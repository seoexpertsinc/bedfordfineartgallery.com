  "body": "Frost was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the early1850s left school to work on a farm. The Civil War intervened and Frost served two years, and some have said that it was at this time that he first started to draw. After the war in 186, he traveled to British Columbia (Canada) to join Franklin Pope, the Assistant Engineer and Chief of Explorations for Western Union Telegraph, to survey and lay an electric telegraph line from San Francisco, California to Moscow, Russia, and in 1866, went to Siberia with American explorer George Kennan to complete the Russian side of the project. During this time, Frost made watercolors of the scenery of the Washington Territory, British Columbia and Siberia. Before embarking on another Siberian expedition with his friend Kennan in 1885, Frost took formal art study with Nicaise de Keyser at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp, Belgium) from 1874 to 1876. Upon returning to the United States, he opened maintained a studio in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1885 when he traveled with Kennan to Siberia as part of the latter’s study of the region and its people for a series of articles for The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Frost’s illustrations of this trip were used in another Kennan book, Siberia and the Exile System. Frost had a summer home in Brownfield, Maine, close to Conway, New Hampshire, in the White Mountains and painted landscapes along the Saco River. He also traveled to the Green Mountains of Vermont to paint. Frost was a member of the Boston Art Club, where he exhibited from 1896 to 1908. He had also exhibited at the San Francisco Art Association (1874).\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $7,638.",
