   "body" : "Frost was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the early1850s left school to work on a farm. The Civil\r\nWar intervened and Frost served two years, and some have said that it was at this time that he first\r\nstarted to draw. After the war in 186, he traveled to British Columbia (Canada) to join Franklin Pope, the\r\nAssistant Engineer and Chief of Explorations for Western Union Telegraph, to survey and lay an electric\r\ntelegraph line from San Francisco, California to Moscow, Russia, and in 1866, went to Siberia with\r\nAmerican explorer George Kennan to complete the Russian side of the project. During this time, Frost\r\nmade watercolors of the scenery of the Washington Territory, British Columbia and Siberia. Before\r\nembarking on another Siberian expedition with his friend Kennan in 1885, Frost took formal art study\r\nwith Nicaise de Keyser at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp, Belgium) from 1874 to 1876. Upon\r\nreturning to the United States, he opened maintained a studio in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, until\r\n1885 when he traveled with Kennan to Siberia as part of the latter’s study of the region and its people\r\nfor a series of articles for The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Frost’s illustrations of this trip were\r\nused in another Kennan book, Siberia and the Exile System. Frost had a summer home in Brownfield,\r\nMaine, close to Conway, New Hampshire, in the White Mountains and painted landscapes along the\r\nSaco River. He also traveled to the Green Mountains of Vermont to paint. Frost was a member of the\r\nBoston Art Club, where he exhibited from 1896 to 1908. He had also exhibited at the San Francisco Art\r\nAssociation (1874).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $7,638.",
