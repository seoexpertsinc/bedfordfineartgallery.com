   "body" : "Bromley was born in Eureka, Wisconsin, the son of an engraver and whose grandfather was an associate\r\nat the British Royal Academy. The family later moved to Chicago, Illinois, where as a student at the\r\nChicago High School, he first exhibited his work in 1873 at the Vienna International Exposition. It was\r\nthere that Bromley won first prize for drawing, a not inconsiderable accomplishment for the fourteen\r\nyear old student. After graduating from high school, Bromley studied with noted landscape painter,\r\nHenry Elkins. In 1880, Bromley, along with Elkins and other Chicago artists founded the Vincennes\r\nGallery of Art. Bromley, as typical with artists of that period, left for Europe in 1880 to further his art\r\neducation. In Paris, he studied under French classicist painter, Jean-Louis Meissoner and Edouard Yon.\r\nBromley was officially recognized as a skilled artist when in 1882 one of his paintings was accepted at\r\nthe annual Paris Salon. He was one of the youngest American artists to receive that honor. Bromley\r\nreturned to Chicago in 1883 where he maintained a studio and taught art classes. He made a second\r\ntrip to France in the latter part of the 1880s. Perhaps motivated by his mentor, Elkins, who traveled to\r\nthe American West for his inspiration, Bromley traveled widely. The Michigan Central Railroad\r\ncommissioned him to do paintings along their route, which included Niagara Falls. It was for the railroad\r\nthat he executed his largest painting, measuring 6 by 10 feet. This exquisite painting of Niagara Falls,\r\nnot only showcases Bromley’s considerable skill as an artist, but the power and majesty of one\r\nAmerica’s geologic wonders. It is probable that this painting is one of the works commissioned by the\r\nMichigan Central Railroad. Bromley won a gold medal at the 1885 New Orleans World’s Industrial and\r\nCotton Exposition. Young Bromley’s untimely death in 1890 deprived the art world of a talented\r\nlandscapist whose exquisitely executed works easily rival those of the Hudson River School artists.",
