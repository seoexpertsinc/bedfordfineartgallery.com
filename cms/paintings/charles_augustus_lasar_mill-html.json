   "body" : "Charles Augustus Lasar, known as 칙춮Shorty칙춯 Lasar was a Johnstown, Pennsylvania-born artist. As did many American artists, he travelled to Paris broaden his art education. He studied under painter-sculptor Jean-Leon Gerome, who also taught Pennsylvania-born artists Mary Cassatt and Thomas Eakins. Lasar칙춫s draftsmanship became legendary during his tenure at Jean-Leon Gerome칙춫s atelier. After several years of successful exhibitions, Lasar opened his own atelier, which catered to English-speaking female artists. Cecilia Beaux, considered the finest woman painter at the turn of the last century and a friend of 칙춮Shorty칙춫s칙춯, described him as 칙춮a funny little man with intensely bright eyes and dark hair, standing around칙춦and his legs about two feet long칙춯. Beaux felt that Shorty칙춫s lessons were too technical; she preferred a more intuitive approach to painting. However, she observed that Shorty칙춫s students 칙춮clung to his strictures as if to a lifeline칙춯.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $7,638.",
