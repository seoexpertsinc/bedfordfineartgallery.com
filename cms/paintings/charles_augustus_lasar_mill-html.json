   "body" : "Charles Augustus Lasar, known as âShorty" Lasar was a Johnstown, Pennsylvania-born artist. As did many American artists, he travelled to Paris broaden his art education. He studied under painter-sculptor Jean-Leon Gerome, who also taught Pennsylvania-born artists Mary Cassatt and Thomas Eakins. Lasar's draftsmanship became legendary during his tenure at Jean-Leon Gerome's atelier. After several years of successful exhibitions, Lasar opened his own atelier, which catered to English-speaking female artists. Cecilia Beaux, considered the finest woman painter at the turn of the last century and a friend of âShorty's", described him as âa funny little man with intensely bright eyes and dark hair, standing aroundâand his legs about two feet long". Beaux felt that Shorty's lessons were too technical; she preferred a more intuitive approach to painting. However, she observed that Shorty's students âclung to his strictures as if to a lifeline".\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $7,638.",
