   "body" : "Barton Stone Hays was born in Greenville, Ohio on April 5 1826. He was self-taught and was known, first for his portrait paintings, and later for his landscape and still life paintings. In the early 1850s Hays migrated to Northern Indiana, where he made a successful career by painting portraits of the Indiana âpioneersâ (Indiana having been admitted as the 19th state only a few years earlier). He was a fervent abolitionist and, after having read Harriet Beecher Stoweâs âUncle Tomâs Cabinâ, painted a panorama depicting the most vivid scenes from that novel. That panorama, and a second one, was met with much acclaim. In 1858 Hays moved to Indianapolis where he became one of the cityâs leading painters of portraits and landscapes.\n\nIn 1882, after moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota, Hays concentrated on still-life painting, for which he is best known. His still-life paintings are small, realistic, uncluttered compositions of fruit set on a table-top, against a muted background. His still-life paintings are much sought-after and the Bedford Fine Art Gallery is proud to have the best collection of Barton Stone Haysâ still-life paintings in the country.",
