   "body" : "Samuel Griggs is known for his paintings of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Griggs started his professional life as an architect in Boston; it is only in 1854 that he is listed in the Boston City directory as an artist--a listing that remained until his death in 1898. The particulars of his art training are unknown; however, it is speculated that he studied under Albert Bierstadt, the renown Hudson School landscape artist, prior to the latter’s catapult to fame. Griggs’ well-executed landscapes are reminiscent of Bierstadt’s highly romantic style of landscape painting. Having found his niche as a White Mountain painter, Griggs never strayed far from Boston and the northeast. In 1858, he exhibited three paintings in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in an exhibition coordinated by Albert Bierstadt. Throughout his career, Griggs exhibited regularly at Boston Athenaeum and the Boston Art Club.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $13,000.",
