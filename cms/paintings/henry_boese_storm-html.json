   "body" : "There is very little biographical information available for native New York artist, Henry Boese (also spelled \"Bose\").  He was born in New York City and is considered to be among the group of First Generation Hudson River School landscape artists.  He likely studied at the National Academy of Design, which was founded in 1825 by Hudson River School artist artists, Thomas Cole and Asher B. Durand (among other noted American artists) as he exhibited there from the late 1840s through the early 1860s.  Did service during the Civil War preempt his art career—temporarily or permanently?  There was a Henry \"Bose\" listed as having served with the 17th Regiment Veteran Infantry, which was organized at Staten Island, N.Y., June 13 to October 17, 1863.  If he served, he survived--the New York Times edition on January 2, 1897 lists a Henry Boese as dying on New Year’s Day.  But did he continue to paint after being mustered out?  His last address was the former Park Centre Hotel located at the corner of 5th Avenue and East 115th Street.  Unfortunately, we can only speculate on his life and academic training of this artist whose wonderful landscapes of the Hudson River valley and adjacent highlands clearly show the influence of the Hudson River School artists. He also traveled into adjacent states to paint--the scenic Juniata River in Pennsylvania; Cold Spring (NY); Newburg on Hudson (NY); North Adams (MA); Cherry Valley in Otsego County, NY; and the Cumberland Valley of Pennsylvania and Maryland.\r\n\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $26,290.",
