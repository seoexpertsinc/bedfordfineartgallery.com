   "body" : "Shepherd was born in Des Moines, Iowa.  Following two years of study at the University of Missouri, he and his brother set off for adventure in the American Northwest.  He lived with the Crow Indians, learned their language and customs, which sparked an interest in sculpting Indian and western subjects.  During World War I, he joined the service and became a pilot in the Signal Corps (now the US Air Force).  Following the war, Shepherd studied at The Chicago Institute, The Beaux Art Institute in Paris, and the Kansas City Art Institute.  Among his teachers were Walter Ufer and Harvey Dunn.  Shepherd started his career as an illustrator in New York City, illustrating covers for the Saturday Evening Post and Colliers magazine and also dust jackets and stories for Zane Grey novels.\n\nHe specialized in realistic paintings of western subjects and animals and was referred to as \"Remington's latest successor\", much to his chagrin.  Shepherd became an art Instructor at Barry College in Miami and later became the first Director of the Norton Gallery School of Art in West Palm Beach.  He opened his own studio and focused on painting murals and portraits of the rich and famous.  Shepherd's western bronzes are on exhibit in museums throughout the United States and Canada.",
