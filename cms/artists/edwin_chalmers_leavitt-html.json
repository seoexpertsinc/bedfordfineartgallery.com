    "body": "Born in Providence Rhode Island, Leavitt attended private schools in Rhode Island and the Kimball Union Academy in Meredith, New Hampshire. It was not until he enlisted in in the United States Navy during the Civil War that he began honing his drawing skills. Leavitt studied with James Lewin, one of the \"Group of 1855\" artists who promoted the arts in Providence. There is speculation that he may have studied with Martin Johnson Heade, the famous landscape painter, during this artist's short tenure in the city. Leavitt went on to become Rhode Island's most successful still-life painter of the nineteenth century. He is most famous for his oil paintings depicting tabletop arrangements of fruit, flowers, dead fish and game, presented in a somewhat baroque manner, but wonderfully textured and detailed.",
