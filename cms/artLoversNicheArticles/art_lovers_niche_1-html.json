The\nmovie is being filmed in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and is entitled\n“Master.” The e-commerce giant recognized what all our many customers\nalready knew – they were able to find art they love that exceeded their\nexpectations. As with all our customers, Amazon was great to work with.
