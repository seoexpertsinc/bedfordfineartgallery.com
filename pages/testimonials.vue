                            Art Gallery has perfected it! Very responsive and no nonsense with true knowledge on all of
                            their paintings. Shipped safely and fast, I’m deciding on my next painting and would trust

                            the purchase of our first piece of 19 th century artwork! Never once did I feel pressured
                            nor was the conversation forced. Jerry readily conveys his passion for and knowledge of the
                            masterful works from this wonderful period in art history. If art speaks, then Jerry ably
                            facilitates the conversation! From the first call through receipt of the expertly packaged
                            artwork, the Bedford Fine Art Gallery excels!"

                            to make sure the painting arrived safely. He is reasonable, knowledgeable, and provides

                            "My husband and I were in the market for 19th century paintings and while doing research I
                            came upon the Bedford Fine Art Gallery website. The music that was playing on the video
                            showcasing the gallery's paintings was our wedding song. One of the paintings by the English
                            artist William Bromley III reminded me of our first date. At that moment the painting met
                            its new owner. Jerry spent much time discussing the details of the painting and about the
                            artist. He also talked about two other paintings that were done by Bromley. The breadth and
                            depth of Jerry's knowledge of art is very impressive. What I especially appreciated was his
                            down to earth manner and his willingness to know his customers. In addition to the "first
                            date" painting, we purchased the two other paintings by Bromley that tell the story of two
                            friends enjoying nature. At the time, I also had my eye on another painting called "The
                            Diary" by a well known French artist August Toulmouche. Due to budgetary constraints I had
                            to let it go but had a feeling I would see it again (I did check now and then to see if
                            anyone purchased it--it was still there!). We then went to Paris to celebrate our 32nd
                            wedding anniversary and that same year I was turning 60!! In keeping with the French theme,
                            my husband purchased "The Diary" as a birthday gift and voila all is well with the world. My
                            belief is that paintings wait for us until we are ready to embrace them into our life and
                            our home. To those of you yearning to go back to the 19th century, the Bedford Gallery will
                            take you there!"

                            Northwest Territory and is today a popular tourist destination. Joan and Jerry Hawk’s

                            "At the suggestion of a dear friend my wife and myself found our way west on the Lincoln
                            Highway to the charming town of Bedford to ferret out Bedford Fine Arts and a unique
                            painting that might find a home in our niche collection of 20th Century transportation art.
                            Not only did we find the painting by Otto Kuhler, but we also found a delightful couple,
                            Joan and Gerald Hawk, who had created a wonderful venue to exhibit and offer for sale a
                            fascinating collection of period American paintings. Combining knowledge and passion with
                            their friendly home spun appreciation for their clients, the Hawks are the most delightful
                            respite from the usual gallery sales approach. We now return to Bedford, not only for the
                            opportunity to see, appreciate, and occasionally acquire an addition for our collection, but
                            more importantly to renew an acquaintance, share pleasant conversation, and enjoy whatever
                            happens to grace the walls of their magnificent gallery. Jerry and Joan’s remarkable ability
                            to acquire, display, and offer for sale an impressive array of American art in a classic
                            American small town setting, is only exceeded by their genuine interest in their client’s
                            collections and the personal stories surrounding the acquisition of each piece in their
                            collection. In our many years of building our collection, we have never had a more pleasant
                            experience or personal interaction with a dealer. So if you are serious about your passion
                            for fine American art, make the effort to acquaint yourselves with Joan and Jerry….and if
                            you want to enhance the experience, stay off the Turnpike and take the time to journey to
                            Bedford on Route 30, from either east or west, and spend the day in Bedford and environs. It
                            will be an experience you will not forget."

                            putting it together. With the addition of smaller paintings from your gallery, in the same
                            style as the larger pieces we already owned, we were able to create a montage of landscapes
                            with a “local scalp level feel” which is cohesive and beautiful. After talking with you and
                            sending photos of the pictures we wanted to work around, you were able to suggest both
                            vertical and horizontal pieces of various sizes which would work in our mix. When my husband
                            and I visited your gallery, we were both pleasantly surprised by the number and variety of
                            beautiful paintings available. You and Joan had already identified the paintings most likely
                            to work for us and it was difficult to choose! Now that the installation Is complete, we

                            section of art museums, galleries and auction houses. I have developed a sense of what I
                            like and that which does not appeal to me. In this regard, my recent interaction with the
                            Bedford Fine Art Gallery prompts this unsolicited testimonial. From my perspective, the
                            Bedford Fine Art Gallery would be the envy of many urban museums and art galleries.<br /><br />Proprietors
                            Joan and Jerry Hawk have established a first class art gallery offering the very best in
                            fine art, professionally arranged displays, state-of-the-art technology, and superior
                            customer service. Joan and Jerry have a good eye and the quality of their artwork is
                            reminiscent of that seen in the very best art museums. Together, they have discovered and
                            conserved a number of art treasures that I am sure would appeal to the most discriminating
                            of collectors. Each piece is well researched and the didactic material provides good insight
                            to the artist and the artwork. You can browse their inventory on a leisurely walk through
                            the Bedford Fine Art Gallery; or page through the Gallery catalogue; or visit the on-site
                            kiosk for information; or go on line at BedfordFineArtGallery.com. <br /><br />If you are
                            interested in acquiring good quality fine art, I recommend that you visit the Bedford Fine
                            Art Gallery at 230 South Juliana Street in Bedford, PA and let Joan and Jerry Hawk be your
                            personal guides to fine art."

                            very different views on why to buy art. Jerry and Joan are simply amazing. Their knowledge
                            and passion are second to none. Not only is the collection at Bedford Fine Art Gallery of
                            museum quality, but their passion really inspires you, comforts you, and welcomes you in as
                            a member of what seems like an exclusive club. We are blessed to know them. They will work
                            with you in every way possible to make your dream come true. Our life is now more beautiful

                            repeated requests to see the painting. Jerry was especially knowledgeable of the artist, the
                            painting, and its provenance. As this purchase was my first real art acquisition, Jerry
                            helped me not only understand the history of the piece but also how it was evaluated and
                            appraised. I hope to acquire more 20th and 19th century oil paintings in the future and will

                            open the gallery. Their knowledge of 19 th century art is extensive and the variety of
                            paintings on display is impressive for any area. The paintings are displayed with museum
                            quality lighting over two floors in the gallery. In recent years, they have added different
                            genres of paintings, and this last Christmas I chose a more modern floral water color, by
                            Michael Struber, for my wife. If you are considering a wall art purchase to decorate your
                            home, we would highly recommend contacting The Fine Art Gallery. We look forward to seeing

                            "We recently purchased a beautiful original oil painting from Bedford Fine Art Gallery. We
                            live in Virginia, and because of Covid 19 and our age, we hesitated on traveling to PA to
                            view this painting. Jerry and Joan were very accommodating. We set up a meeting place in VA,
                            and Joan and Sarah, Art Specialist, met us with the painting, and the purchase was made at
                            that time. This was a 3-4 hour drive for them. We highly recommend Bedford Fine Art Gallery,
                            if you're in the market for some quality art work."

                            upon the website of the Bedford Fine Art Gallery and looked forward to visiting a gallery
                            with this specific focus. As Joan and Jerry Hawk met us at the door and we stepped in, we
                            saw rooms filled with the art we admire and we could tell it was going to be a good day.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The rooms are wonderfully displayed with oil and watercolor paintings and graphite drawings.
                            Art gallery labels, noting background information on the artist and the individual piece,
                            are most helpful. Additionally, the Hawks have made large notebooks with more extensive
                            information on each piece and the artist. It is easy to tell the Hawks love what they do and
                            they willingly share their knowledge. They even demonstrated lighting techniques for a
                            picture’s best presentation. <br /><br />
                            We will undoubtedly visit again to see the art in this remarkable gallery. We brought home a
                            watercolor and have the confidence we were dealt with openly and fairly. "

                            impressed both by the wonderful artwork presented and the very amiable owners. So, one rainy
                            day, we stopped in to see for ourselves. We are so glad we did! It was immediately evident
                            that, for Jerry and Joan, the gallery was not a business but a passion. Their vocation, as
                            geologists, has prepared them for the exacting work they do in collecting and displaying
                            fine 18th, 19th, and 20th century artwork by recognized artists of the respective periods.
                            Jerry and Joan allow the visitor to wander, at leisure, through three floors of paintings
                            worthy of any fine home where art of this caliber is appreciated. Although there is no
                            pressure at all while viewing, both Jerry and Joan are willing and able to give full
                            background information on art and artist, making our visit not only a pleasurable artistic
                            adventure but an education as well. We were taken by both the art and the gallery owners. We
                            actually did make a purchase that fits so well in our early 20th century home and, we must
                            say, the price was exceptional. If we can act as your neighbors and recommend a very
                            pleasing gallery experience, please take a rainy day, or any day, and go visit with Jerry
                            and Joan. You won’t regret it. We might even see you there! "

                            family’s interest in George Hetzel stems from our grandfather, Charles Succop, who took art
                            lessons in Pittsburgh with Hetzel. When a Hetzel painting became available and after I
                            informed Jerry Hawk of our family’s connection to Hetzel, he made it possible for me to make
                            the purchase through a short but much needed payment plan. Without such consideration, I
                            would not have the Hetzel we enjoy today. I recommend BFAG to both the serious art collector
                            and to the one who desires to cultivate a love for fine art. The Hawks are knowledgeable and
                            accommodating, and their love for fine art goes far beyond making a sale."

                            "Recently I had the pleasure to fall upon a treasure trove of hidden jewels; beautifully
                            displayed items for acquisition at affordable prices, and a proprietor partnership that was
                            professional, honest and a joy to know. <br /><br />
                            As a collector of fine art, I was looking for a local gallery for viewing and purchase of
                            19th and early 20th century paintings, particularly those artists native to Western
                            Pennsylvania that formed the Scalp Level school. Following an internet search, I found the
                            Bedford Fine Art Gallery website. What a beautiful and professional website presentation of
                            artwork from many different genres and schools, all for sale to the public. Included with
                            the photos were artists’ bios and in some cases a brief historical narrative of their work
                            and contributions to the field of art.<br /><br />
                            It was obvious from the first look the proprietors of this establishment took their work
                            very seriously, and were totally committed to providing a most professional art purchase
                            experience.<br /><br />
                            My introduction to Gerald Hawk came through an initial phone call. Not only was he
                            knowledgeable of fine art and well connected with the collecting community, he was
                            passionate for his love of art. He treated me with the greatest respect, honesty, and
                            kindness. That was the start of a business relationship that has probably been the most
                            enjoyable I have had the pleasure to experience in my life.<br /><br />
                            In short order, my wife and I visited the gallery, and, in addition to viewing the vast
                            collection of artwork, we had the pleasure of meeting Jerry’s wife, Joan. She shares Jerry’s
                            love of art and is an equal and essential part of their business activities.<br /><br />
                            To anyone who is considering the purchase of a piece of fine art I would strongly recommend
                            contacting the gallery, and make an appointment to view their inventory. You won’t be
                            disappointed. Sincerely, "

                            An Art Lover’s immersion in Beauty and Artistic Heritage - "The passionate combination of
                            the pursuit and discovery of artistic beauty and sharing this with their visitors and new
                            collectors is the hallmark of the Bedford Fine Art Gallery. The special experience of
                            immersing oneself in the luscious palette and paintings of 19th and 20th century in the
                            finely appointed Victorian Mansion of the Bedford Fine Art Gallery is a visual treat as you
                            pass from one elegant room to another. Each turn leads to viewing a fresh and sparkling
                            still life, tender portrait or luminous landscape in these intimate settings. It Is possible
                            to be magically transported through an interior woodland scene or view a broad valley from a
                            mountain escarpment. Each visit is a delightful event at this special treasure in Bedford,
                            PA., always offering a new and memorable vision. This wonderful gallery is often noted to be
                            on par with a 19th century art museum or salon and is not to be missed, including meeting
                            its’ purveyors of art, Joan and Jerry Hawk. Their discerning eye, thorough research, and
                            care in selecting and presenting the best representative art of the period is most
                            impressive. Jerry’s and Joan’s knowledge of each creator’s individual history and work fill
                            a conversation with the lively insights into the period, styles and world of these
                            fascinating artists. Their thirty years of developing these superb skills rivals those of
                            the most learned curators in American art and knowledge. Your interests are important to
                            them and they guide and assist you in finding your own treasure among their finest
                            offerings. I am so pleased to have found so many wonderful selections at the Bedford Fine
                            Art Gallery and to have added to my own collection with a beautiful addition from their
                            inventory. I know I will return again and again to view their wonderful selections and

                            "I first stumbled upon Bedford Fine Art Gallery while searching online for a piece by John
                            Joseph Enneking, my favorite artist. I inquired about several pieces and got a very fast
                            response. I told Jerry that I would be traveling by Bedford Fine Art Gallery the next day
                            and would love to stop in to see the pieces. When I arrived, Jerry and his wife Joan were
                            very welcoming and did not hesitate to show me their incredible collection in addition to
                            the pieces that I was interested in. They were both very knowledgeable and truly care about
                            each and every piece that they own. Ultimately, I was able to take home my very first John
                            Joseph Enneking piece, Woodland Whitewater, and I could not be happier with both the piece
                            and my entire experience at Bedford Fine Art gallery. I hope to do business with both Jerry
                            and Joan again in the near future."

                            "Bedford, Pennsylvania, is a charming colonial town that offers a little something for
                            everyone. A hidden gem in the town is the Bedford Fine Art Gallery, an historic mansion that
                            houses an impressive collection of mainly 19 th century paintings. Joan and Jerry Hawk have
                            turned their beautiful home into a gallery that is warm, welcoming, and filled with
                            significant pieces of art. Everything was impressive, from the careful positioning of the
                            artwork, that caught the light perfectly, to Jerry’s extensive knowledge of the history and
                            background of each piece, to the warm welcome and great customer service. Our impulsive stop
                            while strolling through town turned into a several-hour visit and, ultimately, resulted in
                            the purchase of a unique painting that we could not resist. The Bedford Fine Art Gallery is
                            a destination must that we highly recommend for anyone who appreciates classic American art
                            and superior service."

                            purchasing my first painting in what I hope will become a much larger collection. Jerry's
                            personable nature and passion for artwork furthered my own interest in acquiring a painting
                            which evoked a deep emotional connection. In sum, Bedford Fine Art Gallery is an exceptional
                            art gallery which fosters meaningful relationships based on mutual respect, trust, and an
                            appreciation for the field of art history. I highly recommend Bedford Fine Art Gallery and I

                            Hawk was timely, efficient and productive. He posted an excellent photo of a painting by
                            Mary Hiester Reid. It was true to the condition of the work. He responded immediately to my
                            inquiry, he took a great deal of time with me as he described the work, and he discussed
                            price openly and honestly. His terms made it possible for me to buy it, and he collaborated
                            with a local shipping outfit to pack and send the painting as well. (It was beautifully and
                            securely packed.) I recommend Bedford Fine Art Gallery without reservation!"

                            "Bedford Fine Art Gallery..... the experience for me was all positive. I was searching for
                            various artists from the 19th century that lived in and painted Pennsylvania, which lead me
                            to Bedford PA. Its a pleasure to find such a collection of paintings in a historic
                            atmosphere where background classical music plays.... the lighting shines on each piece
                            perfectly.... and you have details of the artist to make the painting more personal. Jerry
                            and Joan have a business model that works.... they care about your experience at the
                            gallery.... and most important they care about the quality of each painting. If you able to
                            visit the gallery I would suggest giving a few hours to enjoy the artwork. One more tip....
                            if your satisfied how the paintings look online, they are much better in person. I know I'll
                            be back in Bedford soon to purchase another! "

                            "I, fortunately, came in contact with Jerry when I was planning on selling a George Hetzel
                            painting. I was doing a lot of research on different art galleries and art collectors in
                            order to obtain a feeling for someone with a genuine expertise on Hetzel paintings. So, I
                            came upon the Bedford Fine Art Gallery and I reached out to Jerry, since the gallery did
                            mention experience and expertise in 19th century artwork; and it was close in proximity to
                            where I live. After speaking with Jerry several times, I felt very comfortable and confident
                            he would be the best to make a sale with. Upon meeting both Jerry and Joan I knew I made the
                            right decision. They are very passionate about art work and quite knowledgeable on the life
                            and history of the artist. It was a pleasure doing business with them and I would highly
                            recommend the Bedford Fine Art Gallery if you are looking for fairness, honesty and a
                            genuine comfort level in either selling or purchasing fine art."

                            very impressed by the consistently high quality of the works of art on display there. The
                            owners, Joan and Jerry Hawk, were very knowledgeable about each work of art in the Gallery
                            and the art market in general. We found them to be very honest and sincere and never pushy
                            about making a sale despite our interest in several pieces. A few weeks later we decided to
                            purchase an oil painting from them. The overall transaction and delivery exceeded our
                            expectations and we love the painting. If you are interested in purchasing a fine work of
                            art from a dealer you can trust, I would highly recommend Joan and Jerry of the Bedford Fine
                            Art Gallery."

                            further inspection the painting was by the son of the architect that designed my house. How
                            happy I was to find that Bedford fine Art Gallery had not sold the piece. Furthermore after
                            discussing its acquisition with Joan not only did I find the entire process most pleasant
                            but Joan agreed to deliver the painting the very next day which was in fact my birthday. I
                            find this sort of old-fashioned business courtesy so rare these days. What a pleasure to do
