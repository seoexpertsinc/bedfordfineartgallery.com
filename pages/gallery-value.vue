website, join us for email updates via Art Lovers’ Niche, follow us on Instagram,
and stop to see us at the gallery. Many of you are already familiar with Bedford
Fine Art Gallery, but we want to take this opportunity to bring you up-to-date.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Background</strong> – We have always loved art and started collecting over 30 years ago.
In the beginning, we thought a local art expert would be able to help us with our
selections. We quickly found out; however, the so-called art expert was not
honest with us about the paintings we purchased. We stopped seeing this
individual and figured there had to be a better way to feel safe and trust our
purchasing decisions. We, therefore, worked hard to buck the typical galleries
and auction houses by creating a truly unique fine art gallery experience for our
many customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Bedford, Pennsylvania</strong> – Joan was born and raised in Bedford, but we spent our
first 31 years together living closer to Pittsburgh. We always dreamed of owning
an older home. Long story short, we ended up purchasing our home in Bedford,
which is on the street where Joan grew up. It was built in 1889 and, after the
original family was not longer living there, served as a public library (where Joan
would go to read many books!). From the beginning, we thought our Bedford
home would be the perfect venue for a fine art gallery. We are also proud that
Bedford has many great things to offer guests who visit the gallery: The Omni
Bedford Springs resort, several great B&amp;B’s, many specialty shops and boutiques,
great restaurants, and the list goes on!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Technology</strong> – When we were in college in the late ‘70’s, there was one fortran
computer that used key-punch cards for our computer science class! A lot has
changed since then and we felt it is important to stay up-to-date with technology.
Since the beginning of Bedford Fine Art Gallery, we have teamed with website
design experts and are pleased that our customers find the site easy to navigate,
full of representative images and videos, and packed with great fine art for sale.
The proof of this is that a majority of our sales are via the internet to folks that
were not able to visit the gallery in-person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>One big community</strong> – In addition to our Art Lovers’ Niche and Instagram
communities, we also help serve our local community. We are a part of the
Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art (SAMA). SAMA is a fully-accredited museum

that started in 1976 and has five museum locations that serve six counties in
Pennsylvania. We feel fortunate to be able to help with programing for children’s
education, the elderly, and our veterans throughout the local communities.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em"><strong>Bottom line</strong> – Again, we would like to thank all our art-lover friends who have
been with us while we are living the dream! We have worked hard to make
Bedford Fine Art Gallery the most honest art gallery in the world. We have said it
before, but it is needs to be said again – are customers are the best! We feel very
honored when our customers share their many experiences with us, through their
testimonials that we post on the website. Thank you.</p>

                    <h4>Commitment</h4>
                    <p>
                        For over 50 years, Bedford has always been considered home. We (Jerry and Joan Hawk), have over
                        25 years of fine art collecting experience. Gallery co-owner, Joan (Claycomb) Hawk, was born and
                        raised in Bedford, living a few houses up the street from the gallery (often visiting the
                        gallery house, which was a public library at that time). We are wholeheartedly dedicated to
                        Bedford and our gallery. Our customers can trust our passion, commitment and experience in
                        guiding both the new and seasoned collector towards acquisitions that they find aesthetically
                        pleasing.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Small Town Value</h4>
                    <p>
                        Having a fine art gallery in a small, beautiful, historic town like Bedford provides a
                        value-added benefit for our customers. We are not dependent on the gallery for a living and do
                        not have the overhead of a typical fine art gallery such as those in New York or Washington, DC.
                        This allows us to offer superior pricing to someone buying multiple paintings or to the repeat
                        collector.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Quality</h4>
                    <p>
                        As most customers know, fine art can be followed like comparables in the housing market. You
                        must, however, be sure to compare apples-to-apples. With increasing popularity of 19th century
                        and early 20th century paintings and the limited supply of really great works, it is important
                        to buy the best. Our diverse inventory boasts some of the best examples from many well-listed
                        artists. We love realism and each painting was carefully selected to maintain the highest level
                        of quality. We believe we are safeguarding our customers purchase by providing the best quality
                        works available.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Period Correct Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        The foundation of our gallery is to establish and maintain mutually beneficial trusting
                        relationships with home owners, collectors, art connoisseurs, corporations, investors, and
                        interior designers. Whether the painting is for a new home, a stately older home, or an
                        executive office space, our paintings help complement many interior designs. It seems logical to
                        us to incorporate that perfect painting in great condition with your interior design, as opposed
                        to some modern art or prints that tend to be worth pennies-on-the dollar within a very short
                        time.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Trade-In Guarantee</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery backs each purchase of artwork though our trade-in guarantee. If you
                        purchase a painting from us, you may trade-in that painting at any time after purchase for
                        credit against the purchase of a higher cost painting we have for sale. This is ideal for
                        customers who wish to upgrade their collections or just redecorate their wall space. We reserve
                        the right to reject, at our discretion, any painting for trade-in if the painting is in a
                        condition other than that of the original purchase. We believe this trade-in guarantee gives our
                        customers the confidence that their Bedford Fine Art Gallery purchases will retain their
                        original value. The trade-in guarantee does not apply to a consignment painting.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Layaway Plan</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery offers a convenient, flexible layaway plan, as well as accepting major
                        credit cards. If we personally ever had a major purchase that required us to make payments, we
                        have always been very disciplined and regimented with an established payment schedule. This
                        helped us build trust and a great relationship with everyone in the fine art community over the
                        past 25 years. Through time, this allowed us to acquire top-of-the-line artwork to enjoy and
                        invest in, for our personal collection. We believe our flexible layaway program gives our
                        customers this same benefit. Bedford Fine Art Gallery keeps the painting until the agreed to
                        payment schedule is met and the painting is paid off in full.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Select Buying/Consignment</h4>
                    <p>
                        Centrally located in historic Bedford, Pennsylvania, Bedford Fine Art Gallery buys 19th (and
                        early 20th) Century fine art paintings. We are always actively seeking original works by well
                        listed American and European artists. We purchase original works and do not buy prints of any
                        kind. Bedford Fine Art Gallery has a standard for authenticity and condition of paintings we buy
                        and look forward to discussing fine art you are selling. You can call Jerry Hawk (co-owner of
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery) directly at 724-459-0612 or send an email directly to Jerry at
                        jerryhawk@comcast.net Please provide images of the painting (front, back, close-up of signature,
                        etc.), as well as details such as: provenance (purchase history; prior ownership, etc.); artist
                        name; title of painting; medium (i.e. oil on canvas, etc.); sight size of just the painting;
                        overall size of the frame; where the painting is signed (i.e. lower right corner, etc.); any
                        labels or stickers on the back of the frame; and condition (if known, such as any repairs,
                        in-painting, relining, etc.). Jerry will respond to your inquiry about selling fine art
                        immediately and will answer any questions you may have. Unlike an auction house, there is no
                        gamble (painting may not sell for pre-auction estimate), commission, or fees on the amount of
                        money you will receive from selling your fine art to Bedford Fine Art Gallery. We strive to make
                        selling fine artwork to Bedford Fine Art Gallery a straight-forward process that is fair and
                        reasonable. We provide a Purchase Agreement and our payment to you is prompt.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Custom Packaging and Shipping</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery does not provide in-house packaging and shipping; however, we know our
                        customers can rely on a local Bedford specialized packaging and shipping associate. Our
                        customers are serviced exclusively by the owner. Her packaging and shipping services are
                        outstanding. Packaging is customized according to the specific fine art painting, with
                        specialized wrapping, boxing and cushioning materials being used. If requested, MasterPak®
                        shipping boxes for framed artwork can be utilized. These provide three layers of foam protection
                        that snugly encases the artwork, all within a strong corrugated container that offers plywood
                        strength without the weight, cost, and shipping expense.
