                        />Like you, we (Joan and Jerry Hawk) have worked hard in our professional careers. We both are
                        professional geologists. We met in 1982 and married in 1987. We started out with nothing
                        (literally!). Our work ethics, and drive to be the best, have allowed us to live out the
                        American dream. Like you, we own a beautiful home that we are proud of. Way before we met or
                        started our careers, however, we both had a love of art.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is where the story gets interesting. You see, instead of just some run-of-the-mill type
                        hobby, decorating our house with art became our true passion. Like many that first start out
                        buying or collecting in the art market, we were a novice 30 years ago. The one thing we did know
                        for certain was that we both loved antiques and fine art. At that time, we felt fortunate,
                        however, because there was a fine art expert appraiser/restorer that had a gallery near us. We
                        quickly found out that our local “art expert” seemed to know everything about every 19th century
                        artist/painting we would purchase and take to him for an appraisal and restoration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are over 240,000 listed artists. We, therefore, found it hard to believe someone can be
                        that knowledgeable about every 19th century artist/painting we brought to them. We quickly began
                        to suspect this art expert was just telling us what he thinks we wanted to hear. A trip to a
                        free appraisal day at Christies confirmed our suspicions and we found out that not only did our
                        local art expert not know everything, but the new “art expert” told us some of the paintings we
                        purchased were fake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We rose to this challenge, however, and have spent the past 30 years finding solutions to the
                        intimidating fine art market. Our solutions may have initially started out via the school of
                        hard knocks, but we quickly turned back toward the roots of our day job – education, hard work
                        and perseverance (don’t let them wear you down!).

                        Today, we are proud that customers can come visit our 1889 Victorian home/fine art gallery in
                        beautiful historic Bedford, Pennsylvania or visit our outstanding website. Both venues allow our
                        customers to fall in love with a painting they will treasure forever. We are honored to have a
                        great many very smart customers (IT specialists, financial advisors, chocolatiers, doctors,
                        lawyers, dentists, fortune 500 CEO’s, market securities experts, college professors, home

                        improvement consultants, engineers, small business owners, etc.). We are also humbled that our
                        customers trust us as their guide in purchasing unique fine art that they love. Maybe we are
                        old-school, but we truly believe in being honest, fair, and reasonable and that only our
                        customers know what painting speaks to them. In short, we do what we say and really do live our
                        story.

                    <h4>Commitment</h4>
                    <p>
                        For over 50 years, Bedford has always been considered home. We (Jerry and Joan Hawk), have over
                        25 years of fine art collecting experience. Gallery co-owner, Joan (Claycomb) Hawk, was born and
                        raised in Bedford, living a few houses up the street from the gallery (often visiting the
                        gallery house, which was a public library at that time). We are wholeheartedly dedicated to
                        Bedford and our gallery. Our customers can trust our passion, commitment and experience in
                        guiding both the new and seasoned collector towards acquisitions that they find aesthetically
                        pleasing.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Small Town Value</h4>
                    <p>
                        Having a fine art gallery in a small, beautiful, historic town like Bedford provides a
                        value-added benefit for our customers. We are not dependent on the gallery for a living and do
                        not have the overhead of a typical fine art gallery such as those in New York or Washington, DC.
                        This allows us to offer superior pricing to someone buying multiple paintings or to the repeat
                        collector.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Quality</h4>
                    <p>
                        As most customers know, fine art can be followed like comparables in the housing market. You
                        must, however, be sure to compare apples-to-apples. With increasing popularity of 19th century
                        and early 20th century paintings and the limited supply of really great works, it is important
                        to buy the best. Our diverse inventory boasts some of the best examples from many well-listed
                        artists. We love realism and each painting was carefully selected to maintain the highest level
                        of quality. We believe we are safeguarding our customers purchase by providing the best quality
                        works available.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Period Correct Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        The foundation of our gallery is to establish and maintain mutually beneficial trusting
                        relationships with home owners, collectors, art connoisseurs, corporations, investors, and
                        interior designers. Whether the painting is for a new home, a stately older home, or an
                        executive office space, our paintings help complement many interior designs. It seems logical to
                        us to incorporate that perfect painting in great condition with your interior design, as opposed
                        to some modern art or prints that tend to be worth pennies-on-the dollar within a very short
                        time.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Trade-In Guarantee</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery backs each purchase of artwork though our trade-in guarantee. If you
                        purchase a painting from us, you may trade-in that painting at any time after purchase for
                        credit against the purchase of a higher cost painting we have for sale. This is ideal for
                        customers who wish to upgrade their collections or just redecorate their wall space. We reserve
                        the right to reject, at our discretion, any painting for trade-in if the painting is in a
                        condition other than that of the original purchase. We believe this trade-in guarantee gives our
                        customers the confidence that their Bedford Fine Art Gallery purchases will retain their
                        original value. The trade-in guarantee does not apply to a consignment painting.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Layaway Plan</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery offers a convenient, flexible layaway plan, as well as accepting major
                        credit cards. If we personally ever had a major purchase that required us to make payments, we
                        have always been very disciplined and regimented with an established payment schedule. This
                        helped us build trust and a great relationship with everyone in the fine art community over the
                        past 25 years. Through time, this allowed us to acquire top-of-the-line artwork to enjoy and
                        invest in, for our personal collection. We believe our flexible layaway program gives our
                        customers this same benefit. Bedford Fine Art Gallery keeps the painting until the agreed to
                        payment schedule is met and the painting is paid off in full.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Select Buying/Consignment</h4>
                    <p>
                        Centrally located in historic Bedford, Pennsylvania, Bedford Fine Art Gallery buys 19th (and
                        early 20th) Century fine art paintings. We are always actively seeking original works by well
                        listed American and European artists. We purchase original works and do not buy prints of any
                        kind. Bedford Fine Art Gallery has a standard for authenticity and condition of paintings we buy
                        and look forward to discussing fine art you are selling. You can call Jerry Hawk (co-owner of
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery) directly at 724-459-0612 or send an email directly to Jerry at
                        jerryhawk@comcast.net Please provide images of the painting (front, back, close-up of signature,
                        etc.), as well as details such as: provenance (purchase history; prior ownership, etc.); artist
                        name; title of painting; medium (i.e. oil on canvas, etc.); sight size of just the painting;
                        overall size of the frame; where the painting is signed (i.e. lower right corner, etc.); any
                        labels or stickers on the back of the frame; and condition (if known, such as any repairs,
                        in-painting, relining, etc.). Jerry will respond to your inquiry about selling fine art
                        immediately and will answer any questions you may have. Unlike an auction house, there is no
                        gamble (painting may not sell for pre-auction estimate), commission, or fees on the amount of
                        money you will receive from selling your fine art to Bedford Fine Art Gallery. We strive to make
                        selling fine artwork to Bedford Fine Art Gallery a straight-forward process that is fair and
                        reasonable. We provide a Purchase Agreement and our payment to you is prompt.

                    <h4>Custom Packaging and Shipping</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bedford Fine Art Gallery does not provide in-house packaging and shipping; however, we know our
                        customers can rely on a local Bedford specialized packaging and shipping associate. Our
                        customers are serviced exclusively by the owner. Her packaging and shipping services are
                        outstanding. Packaging is customized according to the specific fine art painting, with
                        specialized wrapping, boxing and cushioning materials being used. If requested, MasterPak®
                        shipping boxes for framed artwork can be utilized. These provide three layers of foam protection
                        that snugly encases the artwork, all within a strong corrugated container that offers plywood
                        strength without the weight, cost, and shipping expense.
